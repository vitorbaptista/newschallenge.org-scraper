While there are many community resource directories that collect and distribute such data, these directories remain siloed and incompatible—and as a result, it’s still hard to 'see' the safety net. People struggle to find help. Service providers struggle to address complex needs. And decision-makers struggle to evaluate program effectiveness. Open Referral is moving us beyond this costly, ineffective status quo.","Open Referral launched in ‘14. In March of ‘15, we published version 1.0 of our data specification, which can enable interoperable exchange of resource data between any information system—from conventional call centers like 211 and 311, to web engines like Google, Bing, Yelp, and Facebook. We’re already seeing adoption by Purple Binder (which now supports 3rd party apps in Chicago), iCarol (which serves almost 50% of the conventional call-center market), HelpSteps (in Boston) and others.","By helping community resource information systems become interoperable, we can set forth a cascade of benefits: better resource data can be maintained at collectively lower cost; innovative technology can proliferate and become cheaper; people will more easily find services; service providers will more readily meet complex needs; and researchers, policymakers and funders will better understand public health and community needs. This will yield healthier people and more resilient communities.","Greg Bloom, Chief Organizing Officer, began working on the community resource data problem while at Bread for the City, one of the country’s most innovative anti-poverty organizations. Open Referral was first sparked by Greg’s essay ‘Towards a Community Data Commons,’ in Code for America’s Beyond Transparency. The Open Referral Initiative is now a network that includes hundreds of referral providers, entrepreneurs, academics, and government officials around the U.S. and the world.","Open Referral has early adopters in DC, San Francisco, and Chicago — with new projects emerging in Miami, Boston, Ontario (Canada), and elsewhere. This funding will prompt the selection of one pilot project for a focused year of sprints that solves this problem in one community, while promoting replicable practices and tools across our network and the world beyond. Civic Hall in NYC has offered to be the host site for this next pilot, with the support of key government and non-profit partners."

A critical component in caring for victims of sexual violence is mitigating the long‐term health sequelae of rape. The standard of care is a combination of medications collectively called a post-rape medical kit.  When taken within 72 hours after rape, post-rape medical kits can dramatically reduce the risk of pregnancy, sexually transmitted bacterial infections and the transmission of HIV.  Yet, despite the known efficacy of this therapy, implementation hurdles prevent the timely delivery of these potentially life-saving medications to those who need it most.  </p>","If one knows where post-rape medical kits are being used, one can know where gender-based violence is occurring.","The prevention of pregnancies, HIV infection and sexually transmitted diseases in survivors of rape remains a significant gap in the gender-based violence response globally.  The consequences of that gap are catastrophic as a pregnancy or HIV infection can make the long road to healing impassable.  We are trying to address this need by working together with Panzi Hospital to reimagine immediate post-rape medical care.","The post-rape medical kit project has been operating continuously since 2013.  As a result, Global Strategies and Panzi Hospital have treated 4,446 rape survivors (1325 presented for care within 72 hours and received rape kits) while generating a real-time map of post-rape medical kit usage across the participating clinics.  The team at Panzi Hospital has incorporated the rapid-response mobile team into the program, allowing the project to respond to episodes of mass violence.","The nature of this horrific gender-based violence is that it thrives in areas where information is the most difficult to obtain.  Yet, we are seeing that using only local people and cloud-based data systems, it is possible to provide care to women even in the most remote corners of the globe while shining a light on these atrocities.  A successful outcome for this project would be for our model to become the new global standard for caring for survivors of gender-based violence.","Dr. Denis Mukwege is the founder and director of Panzi Hospital.

                </p>",Data Summer Camp and Fellowship,Preparing students to work as qualified data storytelling professionals to better inform the community.,"<p>Students need digital skills. Media organizations need new employees who are immediately prepared to work in a fast-paced, data-storytelling environment. Few journalism departments are able to provide this level of technology training to meet the needs of the profession. And computer science departments are not necessarily teaching the Web development techniques that are in demand at media organizations. Code schools like General Assembly and MakerSquare have sprung up around the country to address this need. But, so far, none of these schools are specifically focused on training in data journalism. These programs are also costly, requiring students to pay $10,000 - $16,000 often on top of college debt, for an immersive, 12-week program in general coding techniques. Students are clamoring for these skills and should be able to emerge from a university program with this expertise.</p>","The Data Summer Camp and Fellowship will be a cross-university, cross-discipline, cross-organizational, immersive summer training program in programming and data techniques that will directly provide interns to assist local media organizations with data projects that will inform individuals and communities through innovative, cutting-edge, storytelling methods.","Communities need help understanding vast public information, social media data and data created by polls and surveys. Students need a digital mindset leading to gainful employment. Media organizations need professionals able to tell interactive stories with data. By working with journalism schools, computer science departments and media organizations, this unique program can provide foundational programming knowledge to be directly applied in a professional environment.","Cindy Royal worked with computer science faculty on a course Coding and Data Skills for Communicators (<a href=""http://coding.cindyroyal.net"" target=""_blank"">http://coding.cindyroyal.net</a>). One student with no previous coding experience had a project that was a finalist in the 2015 Online Journalism Awards. Royal's Stanford Fellowship was focused on understanding coding needs of the journalism profession (<a href=""http://codeactually.com"" target=""_blank"">http://codeactually.com</a>). At Univ. of Texas, classes are offered in Coding for Journalists, App Design and Data Visualization. We are excited to combine efforts.","Each participating news organization will continue to improve their service to individuals and the community with reporting that is personalized, meaningful and relevant. They will gain qualified talent, while students gain important skills and a portfolio leading to permanent employment. And we'd all learn from each other. This project offers the opportunity to replicate programming education on a scale that is not yet offered in the field of data journalism.","• Cindy Royal, Associate Professor, Texas State University, School of Journalism and Mass Comm<br>• R.B.

The data is displayed as a 2D/3D sphere that reveals what ""shape they are in."" A well-rounded sphere indicates a desirable condition. Dents in the sphere indicate areas that need improvement. The citizens also evaluate the wellbeing of their city (crime prevention, healthcare, transportation, etc.) The combined data appears as a CitySphere that tells everyone what shape the city is in as the citizens themselves perceive it.","There are plenty of 21st century technologies for collecting  personal and civic data, but when it comes to displaying the results and deriving meaning from the data stream we default to 20th century charts and graphs that tend to be static, hard to interpret and, well, boring and non-engaging.

CitySphere makes the data clear, actionable and fun.","The CitySphere model is based on a patented 3D visualization model and process. The CitySphere app and community model remains a concept at this point, but the model it is based on has been developed and tested in business, healthcare, education and social applications. It has been found to greatly accelerate and deepen understanding of complex systems by creating a shared contextual awareness of the overall condition of the system, which leads to better decisions and more appropriate actions.","Cities, towns and communities across the country, and globally, will use the CitySphere to quickly and easily monitor their wellbeing -- to SEE how they are doing.

Smaller newsrooms don’t have the capital to pay for their own custom CMS and often resort to the few inexpensive or open-source alternatives available, like WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla.  The 24/7 news cycle makes it hard to innovate, and small newsrooms often lack programming support.

However, the format of stories is still the same as before the “data revolution”. Most data driven articles are published as text with charts embedded as image and so the link to the data source is lost.</p>","The Gamma allows data journalists to create rich interactive articles backed by simple source code that connects the visualization with its data source. This means that reports can be modified and results reproduced, but we also automatically provide user interface that lets readers change important parameters of the visualization.","Most data driven reports published today cannot be easily modified and reproduced. The typical process of building such reports involves a number of error-prone manual steps and so it is easy to make hard to discover mistakes. Finally, building an interactive article that would let readers change parameters and make the report relevant to them and their community is extremely difficult. We are building tools to make data journalism more transparent, reproducible and relevant to the readers.","We built a proof of concept that shows viability of our approach.

Using the Sunlight Foundation’s collection of state bills and model legislation scraped from lobbying groups from around the country, we will build tools to shed light on the origination and diffusion of policy ideas across the 50 states, the effectiveness of various lobbying organizations, and the democratic nature of individual bills, all in near real time.</p>","The Legislative Influence Detector uses advanced machine learning to find the true source of state legislation -- whether it was written by legislators, lobbyists, or special interest groups -- so citizens, journalists, and watch groups can trace policy from its source as it winds its way through state legislatures around the country.","Researchers and concerned citizens would like to know who’s writing legislative bills, but trying to read those bills, let alone trace their source, is tedious and time consuming. This is especially true at the state and local levels, where arguably more important policy decisions are made every day. This tool helps watchdogs stretch their limited resources further by flagging legislative text re-use within seconds.","We collected 550,000 state legislative bills and 2,400 pieces of model legislation, built the search engine, and found thousands of matches across these documents. When the user enters a bill, the tool returns potential matches and highlights similar text (see the included image.) Using these data, we have also built state-level networks of influence from ALICE and ALEC, the two best-known state lobbying groups from the left and right respectively.",This project would be a success if journalists used it to not only help them research bills of interest but also to find legislative influence in bills off their radar. We envision 1) a user-friendly website that allows a journalist to enter a bill in a text box and get potential matches in return and 2) a notification system that checks every state bill introduced that day and emails potential matches to journalists.,"Rayid Ghani, chief scientist for the Obama 2012 campaign, director of the UChicago Center for Data Science and Public Policy (DSaPP), and computational text analysis expert<br><br>Joe Walsh, political science PhD, data scientist at DSaPP, political text analytics<br><br>Lauren Haynes, DSaPP, user-interface expert<br><br>Eugenia Giraudy, UC-Berkeley political scientist, political text analytics<br><br>Matt Burgess, UMichigan computer scientist, computational text expert<br><br>Julian Katz-Samuels, UMichigan engineer","Center for Data Science and Public Policy, University of Chicago"

Government agencies purchase similar goods and services (frequently from the same vendors) - but often pay vastly different prices. This is largely due to a lack of pricing transparency in government purchasing. SmartProcure maintains the only database of actual prices paid by agencies - enabling a level of pricing visibility that allows other agencies to find best prices and the vendors who offer them. </p>,"Our database of over 250 million local, state and federal agency purchase order records creates unprecedented transparency into local, state and federal government purchasing. We help government Buyers easily find vendors, best prices, hard to locate items, validate vendors and request vendor quotes. We help Purchasing Managers see overall agency purchasing performance, opportunities to save money, ways to create efficiencies, and views into procurement policy compliance.","Government purchasing exists in a vacuum - with little visibility into the prices agencies are paying for similar goods and services. This leads to enormous price disparities on the same purchases across agencies - and, therefore, (sometimes staggering) overspending.  Procurement processes are cumbersome and time consuming and are generally performed without the benefit of data and technology - leading to equally enormous inefficiencies. Our application effectively addresses both of these issues","SmartProcure's national database has grown to include purchase order records from over 10,000 local, state and federal agencies - growing by millions of purchase order records each week.  We have thousands of vendors clients - but have just begun engaging governments in using the application to save money and time on their purchasing activities. We have the only patent issued for accepting, normalizing, cleansing, and uploading this purchase order data into a common database.","We want to scale our platform to a point where we can leverage the purchasing power of agencies across the nation to get unprecedented best pricing on every product and service local, state and federal agencies buy. We also want to use the platform's purchasing data and intelligence to streamline purchasing practices and help government save enormous amounts of time and money as they purchase goods and services.","SmartProcure's executive team has diverse experience. Our founder is a lawyer and has started and sold several successful tech companies. Our Vendor practice EVP was a contract negotiator for the U.S. Navy and IT an consultant for PWC. Our Government practice EVP has held executive positions at ATT, Charles Schwab and Code for America.

As we use our mobile devices and collect more and more data one problem remains: the data is unstructured and cannot be easily combined. We love and embrace the linked data approach, but its detail does not reach the local citizen and the local community. Most of the local information that is needed by the citizens is not available as linked data. This project has the goal to change that and by doing so improve satisfaction of the citizens and also improve the efficiency of the public officeses by reducing redundancy and workload. </p>","As a citizen I want to know, what is happening around me and how can I participate. For this I need a single source of truth with information about upcoming decisions in the town hall in my county and also in the surrounding counties. I need accurate information about local shops and events. This information should be structured and open.","Basically all the information is available in one form or another but not in a structured, machine readable way and not in one place where it can be combined. Many people don't spare the effort to check the many sources and then they are surprised when suddenly construction machines appear in front of their lawn. This then leads to protests and disappointment.<br>Also many interesting events take place near your home town an you hear about them after they happened.","A first version with limited functionality is already available in the app store (""Mein Bad Wimpfen"").

Those who will be most affected by the outcome of a treaty or peace accord have little outlet to channel their own voices directly into the process.  The Cyprus People's Peace Talk will create an online space for citizens to engage and learn parallel to the current peace talks, and it will simultaneously become its own archive.","We have the idea, an outline of the prototype, a commitment to open source principles, and a list of tools (Vanilla Forums, Screen Door, Open StreetMap/Mapbox) that we will incorporate when building out our user interface.  We also have a growing list of organizations and individuals that we would like to approach for collaborating on the ground in Cyprus for community engagement.","Build an active, open, and growing community of users that contribute to the prompts and create their own; create an archive of geolocated, qualitative data points and their visualizations in the form of interactive maps and other interactive storytelling tools; host at least 2 events IRL for user community in Cyprus; ultimately have a repeatable structure and user interface that could be used for on-the-ground storytelling in other conflict situations","Madeline Blount: research, art, code.

Perhaps the greatest feedback has been the need for an interface that offers access to all these modalities in a single experience.","A successful outcome would be the creation of a set of visualizations and analytic interfaces more attuned to the needs  of journalists and citizens, especially in terms of intuitive interface and the kinds of capabilities offered, that creates a more globally-informed public.","The team principle and technology lead will be the founder of the GDELT Project, Kalev Leetaru (<a href=""http://kalevleetaru.com"" target=""_blank"">http://kalevleetaru.com</a>/), who has a deep background in these areas and has been developing web technologies for 20 years.

Our mission is carried out through four policy areas, environmental health, healthcare systems, health coverage, and nutrition resources.  </p>","South LA Data Action Center will have three components; The Data Warehouse will be built using an existing online-management information system (MIS), Training will be conducted for our partners and other stakeholders to use the system, to understand the data and to advocate for community health, and Dissemination of key findings in user-friendly formats such as fact sheets, social media tools and short reports for journalists, policy makers and community members.","CHC involves stakeholders in community assessments-but barriers like limited literacy levels and time make it difficult for their input.  In 2012-2014, our partners were involved in many efforts but few were able to contribute to the methods or the interpretation of our findings. While data sharing agreements were made, few have requested using the data for their own efforts. Therefore, South LA Data Action Center would contribute to build community capacity and engagement.","CHC will use an existing online-management information system (MIS) for stakeholders to use and download data in an easy format like Microsoft Excel for their own use towards community health improvements. The MIS will house existing datasets that reflect the conditions, opinions and behaviors of local residents in disparate neighborhoods to be used by others for advocacy. CHC will have the opportunity to share these data and contribute to the overall health of South Los Angeles.","Multiple methods and approaches, data sources and units of analysis will be required to measure success of South LA Data Action Center.  We believe successful outcomes are increased capacity and knowledge of our community stakeholders and partners,  increased utilization of the data warehouse and training tools, increase in the number of advocacy efforts that refer to community-level data and an increase in the number of media impressions related to community-level data.","Gabriel N. Stover, Director of Research and Evaluation, will direct the project. Ms. Stover has expertise in CBPR, evaluation methods and project management. For over 20 years, she has worked with multi-disciplinary teams of academic, community partners and other stakeholders on health-related and research-focused projects. In addition, she has trained community-based practitioners in research methods by bridging community-based efforts with academic rigor for achieving health equity.","South Los Angeles (SLA) is home to approximately 988,742 individuals or 9% of Los Angeles County (LAC). African Americans and Latinos make up over 95% of the population and 36% of residents live below federal poverty level compared to 17% in LAC. SLA health status shows disparity- adult obesity rate is 32.7% - 33.8% compared to 23.6% in LAC, diabetes (10.1% in SLA compared to 9.5% in LAC); and adult hypertension (between 25.3%-28.4% in SLA compared to 24% in LAC)."

Linking this to communication channels will enable journalists, residents and others to act upon the various revelations. This will lead to a more connected, prosperous, and caring city.<br>Importantly, all this will take place while protecting the privacy of those accessing the .nyc sites.","To date this has been a discussion project within Connecting.nyc Inc., a NYS nonprofit established to introduce the .nyc TLD to city residents, businesses, and government officials. The key policy discussants at Connecting.nyc have been Thomas Lowenhaupt and Robert Pollard, both with decades of experience with technology and policy developments. <br>We have had technical discussions with registry operators, DNS and BIND developers, and ICANN staff.","This is being designed to benefit those living within the borders of the city of New York. However, as an Internet project it will be accessible globally, providing advantage to those visiting or doing business in New York City.

Presevent harnesses public data about upcoming Election 2016 events and presents that data to users, who can share information about upcoming events with their family, friends, and communities.","Last month, Presevent launched its iOS app on the Apple App Store, and since May 2015, Presevent has tracked the location, time, and ticket cost of over 1,000 public events for 25 Republican and Democratic presidential candidates. Presevent has also maintained active Twitter and Facebook pages, alerting users of upcoming events through social media platforms.","A substantial increase in the amount of in-person and unfiltered interactions between candidates and voters would be a success for Presevent.

It's an educational tool that could be used by educators but isn't because no one has documented the success of these programs. I plan to delve into this issue and write a White Paper that will influence educational institutions to create journalism programs for at-risk youth.,"The nation's public school system is failing to produce students who can analyze complex issues and figure out the sources of problems. The process of producing high-caliber journalism teaches students how to question, research, and find answers to real-life issues that affect them. It turns passive, disconnected youth into active civic players. Documenting the success of teen journalism programs and outlining models educators can emulate will persuade educators to create these vital programs.","I've done a lot of research previously on after-school academic programs and which ones are the most effective and why and have done lots of research on the ways that content in curriculum can either excite or turnoff student engagement and interest.

                    In the early 1990s, during his stormwater research for the EPA, Melton discovered that what we were hearing in the media about climate change was understating what climate scientists were saying in their academic findings. Climate change (in general) was actually worse than what the alarmist media had been telling us. By shortly after 2000 the disconnection grew so large that he began writing and speaking about climate change. In 2005 he had a publisher for his full color book on climate change—the first of its kind. The publisher would not do color however and his outreach training had taught him that color is tremendously important in communicating complicated science, so he turned them down. Six months later Al Gore published his full color An Inconvenient Truth, proving Melton’s book model but killing that  project. Melton knew he needed another hook, so he picked up his cameras and went to Greenland and deserted barrier islands and Alaska and the High Rockies and began filming and writing about climate changes happening now.  His climate change knowledge base now has about 400 reports on academic climate science work, about 50 popular press articles, two documentaries on climate changes already underway, a book about 42 recent, relatively unknown climate science discoveries and about three dozen blues, rock and folks songs written with climate issue lyrics. The films are somewhat experimental, focusing on reality based concepts and using songs with lyrics, played by Melton's band Climate Change, as a binding tie.
                </p>",Bluie West,Lines blur between reality and climate change. Bluie West makes them clear.,"<p>This story takes place 20 years in the future. Its grand Orwellian twist is that the science and impacts are all happening today.  The reason that climate things happening today can be portrayed as fiction happening in the future is that the perceived climate change debate, created by the $900 million a year climate change counter-movement (CCCM), has so crippled current climate science outreach that media reporting has been strongly compromised. (1, 2)  A very significant proportion of factual current climate science and impacts happening now are virtually unknown outside of academia. The main mission of the Climate Change Now Initiative is to communicate these unknown current scientific findings to the public.</p>","This outreach effort presents current facts of climate change in the future when we all know they will happen. The project is an epic action/adventure film series about love, relationships, music and the documentary film industry where a cultural revolution has begun to defeat the influence of money and power in world governance. Climate change impacts play only a background role.","Climate science outreach has failed because of false uncertainty created by the perceived debate. Solutions being implemented today were developed in the early to mid-1990s. Far greater effort is needed today. The IPCC has stated bluntly that we must remove carbon from our skies at a rate that is ""strongly"" greater than the rate that we are emitting. The emerging discipline of global warming psychology explains how to create better outreach. Bluie West implements these suggestions.","A draft script and supporting project documents are ready for presentation. Project documents include: a 240 page script (adequate for two films), copious scientific references, and a project summary document that includes: <br><br>Introduction <br>Synopsis <br>Background <br>Global Warming Psychology <br>Raison D’etre <br>Film Project Concept <br>Cast Selection <br>Music <br>Additional Films <br>Appendices <br>Appendix A: Cast <br>Appendix B: Scientific Basis and References <br>Appendix C: Melton’s Credentials","Because this project is an epic film series, significant support is needed.

Coupled with the sharp decline in locally based investigative journalism, the need for increased public oversight is more urgent than ever. The Hummel Report's mission since its creation in 2009 has been to expose waste and corruption in local government. To further this mission, the Hummel Report has a goal to develop an interactive database of city and town public documents and video recordings of public meetings within Rhode Island.</p>","Our goal is to develop an interactive database of city and town public documents from within Rhode Island, such as annual budgets and monthly check registers, and video records of public meetings, to be stored and maintained through public libraries in each respective community, as a source of information for both the general public and the journalist community.","Traditional news outlets no longer have the resources to monitor local governance as they once did.  Yet as local school and municipal budgets continue to grow, it is more important than ever for citizens to be informed with easy  access to the public documents and meetings.","Rhode Island  state law requires that each public municipal meeting is recorded and aired, thus providing the data necessary for this portion of the project, but no database of these meetings currently exists.  Regarding the database of public documents, current staff at the Hummel Report has experience in the past collecting and categorizing this data.","Successful integration of this project would result in each local library becoming the go-to-source for the public documents and video recordings of public meetings in each of their respective communities, as well as providing the information for online access.","Jim Hummel is the Executive Director of the Hummel Report and acts as the senior investigator.

We will provide it to them.,"<p>Everybody seems to think that local journalism is struggling, and that there is no longer a sustainable revenue model to keep them in business. At a macro level this may indeed be true, but at a micro level - in hyperlocal communities - there are actually a growing number of publishers creating compelling and engaging content for the members of their community. This is not an endeavor that will scale up in an exponential manner - it's a powerful, important and sustainable business for a local entrepreneur who wants to serve their community just like a local plumber, florist or restaurant serves their local community.</p>","Local communities have a wealth of information that needs to be organized and presented to individuals. Hyperlocal publishers are the conduit, but they don't have the tech staff to perform this. We are building an API (and associated plugins) that local digital publishers can leverage to harness the power of local content... combine it with their knowledge of the community... and present a solution to consumers more powerful than anything that exists today. Because it is inherently local.",We are creating a new and sustainable revenue source for hyperlocal digital publishers. These local publishers are the lifeblood of local news and a powerful source for the community that large platforms like Facebook and Google cannot easily capture and present. They require a reliable revenue model that goes beyond grants and donations. Our goal is to enhance that power and make the local publisher *the* authority locally.,"We started a beta pilot in Summer 2015 with 6 publishers and learned a great deal. We now know that a strong and consistent Marketing strategy is necessary to launch and grow this effort in each community. The local publisher doesn't have time or staff to do anything new, so Bizyhood would like to kick start the Marketing effort in each community and provide that as part of the initial signup package. We do not charge for our platform until the publisher starts generating new revenue.","The combination of our technology platform and Marketing program, offered to local publishers, will establish a brand new and sustainable revenue stream for these publishers.

Scientific inquiry directly contributes to this when we conduct research about peoples' well-being during their day, specifically what factors may cause someone to be healthier or more productive. However, individuals have different responses and outcomes based on different behaviors, so our goal is to help people personalize their own understanding of themselves. This will be achieved by empowering people to collect data about themselves (personal informatics data) through a 3-step procedure:</p>","Our project will provide software and educational resources for people to better take advantage of the data they can track about themselves such as location/sleep/productivity/mood/spending/fitness, using a privacy-preserving state-of-the-art machine learning platform, and by providing layman's guides about data collection using technology then benefiting from that data to learn about oneself as N=1 analyses and experiments.","Today, the way we learn about ourselves is primarily through researchers conducting studies to discover effects for the general population. For example, sleep clinicians give general sleep hygiene guidelines like ""go to bed earlier"" or ""don't drink alcohol before bed"". But people are so different in their behavioral responses: some are heavy sleepers, some are less sensitive to light, some are night owls. We provide the tools for people to better track and understand themselves using self data.","1) Built preliminary software for improving sleep from raw sensor data by automatically generating personalized recommendations that use causal models.<br>2) Developed a personal informatics course at Brown University (to be offered in Spring 2016) for students to learn about self-monitoring and self-experimentation.

Produced and executed by BetaNYC, the CIF program holds a six-week “bootcamp” intensive for participating CUNY students – training them in technology, data, and design skills. Afterward, these students are each placed at one of Manhattan’s local Community Boards. Therefore, participating students not only receive training in a wide range of newly-relevant technical skills, they also receive exposure to and experience with a professional and active branch of NYC government. At the same time, Community Boards receive otherwise unattainable support – from student members capable of applying the most up-to-date methods of civic technology to each Community Board’s day to day operations as well as their long-term planning. In this way, CIF seeks to move Community Boards into the 21st Century through the thoughtful application civic technology and the creation of new collaborative relationships between community leaders and motivated youth; from its outset, the CIF has been a program of both government innovation and youth service.</p>","This program is a government innovation &amp; youth education program; each year, the program trains CUNY students in technology, data, &amp; design before placing them for 6 month internships at a Manhattan Community Board; the program develops important skills &amp; jumpstarts youth participation in government, as well as aids Community Boards in developing appropriate data-driven decision making in hyper-local settings.","The CIF program enables Community Boards to develop new tools to address community problems while adhering to open source &amp; open data principles.

With an initial group of 12 students (placed at 12 participating Manhattan Community Boards), the 1st year of the program proved the validity of the formula. A simple data curriculum was developed and delivered to students. Community Boards were surveyed and observed to assess the program’s effectiveness. The MBPO’s review of the program revealed that new leadership would be necessary to grow the program.","In the short term (next 5 years), a successful outcome of the CIF program would be the establishment of a basic, effective curriculum and the solidification of the relationship between Community Boards and the Service Corps program.

This is the case in Boston, as well in other major metropolitan areas, where journalists at newspapers of record and in establishment hives often live and network in cozy enclaves far away from troubled areas. As a result, issues that deserve significant coverage often slip through the cracks, and go missing in the widening communication gaps between outlets and those who they purport to serve.","BINJ has already launched a number of community and reader initiatives leading up to BINJ MOBILE. Three projects in particular, all of which would be additionally empowered through a roving media workshop, demonstrate our progress thus far: “Action Boxes” after stories which feature information for further engagement; our #BINJbrother campaign through which the public is helping us map surveillance cameras; pop-up newsrooms around Greater Boston for interviewing residents directly.","Success is for content from BINJ MOBILE to inform features, and for dialogues and tips to seed investigations. We will work with young people from Press Pass TV, which teaches media literacy, and in partnership draw on data generated to visualize stories and map communities using an online tool like CartoDB.

For example, this data includes program participant demographics like age and income level, the number of days of housing assistance provided, or gallons of clean water delivered.

Additionally, many nonprofit organizations cannot afford expensive consultants to design and execute complex evaluations.

Better understanding the impact key medicines are having on the global burden of disease will help policy makers better prevent and treat infectious diseases that threaten millions of human lives. Supported by a collaboration of researchers from universities and civil society organizations around the world, our model evaluates the global health consequences of medicines for malaria, tuberculosis (TB), and HIV/AIDS and aggregates this information by company, drug, and disease as well as country (http://global-health-impact.org). The model shows which drugs are alleviating the largest amount of death and disability in each country in the world, where great needs remain unmet, and to what extent this is due to lack of access to effective drugs. Its methodology is significantly different than that embodied in previous models as it estimates in a simple, transparent, and consistent way the health consequences of drugs for several diseases and can be extended to evaluate a broad range of interventions. </p>","We shall refine our model of the health impact of pharmaceutical companies' products by utilizing expanded data that captures disease impact in the absence of treatment, differential treatment length for all medicines, more recent studies on the global disease burden, and the products of generic pharmaceutical companies, all with the intent to validate the model against other important metrics of global health and also to make the resulting interactive model and database publicly available.","Millions of people globally are suffering and dying from diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS.

Learning to access the good while avoiding the bad takes a little skill and practice, but it is even harder for those who are unfamiliar with using new types of technology to access that data.<br><br>I hope to one day create an ultra local network of communities that helps pan those muddied waters for the rare gems of relevant information and then with their help, create a shared repository of that curated knowledge for public access.  A kind of distributed information grid for locally relevant news, events, and opportunities tying together all of the local resources in a county in a way that lets keeps it's citizen's informed. <br><br>In order to do this, I decided to first get more people comfortable with using the technology they know and introduce them to more advanced concepts in a way that doesn't make them feel overwhelmed. Since people tend to be most inclined to try new things when playing games or competing with friends, I came up with the Briar Challenges. </p>","There is a serious disconnect between the amount of technology that different generations are comfortable with using and this gap will only get wider as new ways of accessing technology are released to the public.

It has become cheaper to have something created and shipped from the other side of the planet than it is to have it made in the neighboring town. <br>Communities need to adapt to survive &amp; I believe that only by taking advantage of new technologies will they be able to stay relevant and survive in this information age. The Briar Challenges will add a few more assets to the community toolbox.,The smartphone app is still under development but will be finished soon. Next step is to bring the storyboards to life by creating the digital content. Local business have already agreed to support the Briar Challenges by offering to be clue locations and in-kind prize certificates. Local organizations have expressed a desire to host events as well as provide volunteers to set up for the standalone adventures. Hiring an outside agency for the digital production would accelerate &amp; make it better.,"A successful outcome for this project would be if Briar Challenges started popping up all over the world, each one linked to a local cause, played by locals, and helping people everywhere to learn how to have fun with new forms of technology instead of being intimidated by them. <br>As more Communities join in we can then introduce new concepts and inspire locals to teach others what skills they have learned, we might just teach each other the skills we need to adapt to our new information age.","Genevieve Martinez<br>My experience is in sales, but the skills and knowledge I used to create the Briar Challenge is mostly self-taught from hobbies.

For a doctor or nurse working in these settings neonatal data, if it is available at all, is presented in an unusable format as a national statistic.  We are trying to transform neonatal data from annals to blueprints.    Our goal is to make neonatal data actionable by making it local, parsing health data down from the national to the clinic level.","Over the past 2 years, team members have developed and conducted initial tests of NoviGuide.  We produced the 3D neonatal resuscitation animation, created the clinical pathways and wrote interactive learning modules covering a range of neonatal topics.

Based to a large degree on an amalgam of indicators and methods already used in compiling the Genuine Progress Indicator, Gross National Happiness, and Outcomes Based Budgeting, GPI Plus will rely primarily on open-source data.  (Some supplementary survey research data may need to be collected, per the GNH-inspired parts of the methodology.)  The work consists of several distinct activities, some of them necessarily sequential:  </p>","My idea is to combine a revised Genuine Progress Indicator (a measure of sustainable economic wellbeing) with other indicators that measure aspects of wellbeing that can't be calibrated in money (things like ""good governance,"" ""strong community bonds"" and ""equality of opportunity""), thus producing GPI Plus--a dashboard of indicators that is based largely on publicly available data and that could be standardized across cities, counties, states, and countries.","The goal of an economy ought to be to provide the maximum possible amount of ecologically sustainable well-being, but we have no indicators to tell us whether and when we are moving toward this goal.  Gross Domestic Product measures gross economic activity, not net economic gain.  Nor does economic gain always correlate with improved wellbeing (as when longer working hours lead to decreases in health and social engagement).   We need a data-based indicator set that measures total wellbeing.","The research group at the Gund Institute has done compilations of the GPI for Vermont and Massachussetts that cover the past 50 years, and a one-year GPI compilation of all 50 states.  We have networked with the National GPI Technical Advisory Committee.

                    The Participatory Politics Foundation (PPF) is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization with a mission to increase civic engagement. Our next project is Councilmatic, an open-data site for transparency &amp; engagement with city governments, launching a new version for NYC. Previously, we developed AskThem.io, the first Q&amp;A platform for every U.S. elected official. From 2006-2013, we managed OpenCongress, the most-visited non-profit site for tracking and understanding bills in the U.S. Congress, as well as OpenGovernment.org for state-level info and the innovative Contact-Congress community project.

Official city legislative websites aren't used by the public at large to follow the issues they care about. Public meetings and committee hearings are a key part of legislating, but it's difficult to follow their schedules and deliver timely input. Council members want to listen to input from constituents &amp; neighborhood groups, but gov't offices don't have websites that structure public feedback for hearings.","<a href=""http://Councilmatic.org"" target=""_blank"">http://Councilmatic.org</a> is live in three U.S. cities so far: Philadelphia, Chicago, and NYC, launching on Sept. 30th at the Code For America Summit.

The Chicago version was created by DataMade in 2013, who also worked with PPF to develop the NYC version. Re-factored for the Open Civic Data standard, Councilmatic now includes explainers of legislative process &amp; comment features to ""verify"" council offices.","City residents will have a new platform for tracking meaningful information in their city's legislative process, staying informed about upcoming public events, and delivering public comments to local elected officials.

Bosnia covers the north and centre of the country with its name probably derived from 'bosana', an old Indo-European word meaning water, which Bosnia has no short of. The southern region of ancient Hum, ruled by Herceg Stjepan (Duke Stjepan),was later named Herzegovina after the region was conquered by the invading Ottomans. Perhaps what is most important for the visitor to know today, though, is that Bosnia and Herzegovinais a stunningly beautiful country with a vast array of landscapes, cultures, traditions and people. And as the old cliche goes 'people make the place' – and BiH prides itself on its hospitality and treating our guests as if they were family members. And family we take to heart. There are many fascinating destinations throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina for every type of tourist. In BiH, one gets the best of both worlds. Here, the most interesting and attractive sites are a wonderful mix of this tiny country's cultural and natural heritage. It is almost impossible to separate them, for it is from this pristine nature that its cultures and traditions evolved. One would expect a lot less from such a small country, yet Bosnia and Herzegovina is establishing itself as one of newest and most exciting tourism destinations in southeast Europe. With a vast array of attractions and a diverse menu of activities BiH is sure to surprise and please any type of traveler. Tourism is becoming a great contributor the Bosnian economy. As a result Bosnia-Herzegovina now has a wide tourist industry and a fast expanding service sector thanks to the strong annual growth in tourist arrivals. The country also benefits from being both a summer and winter destination with continuity in its tourism throughout the year.  Bosnia and Herzegovina begs for affirmation of its natural, cultural and human resources, in a sophisticated and unpretentious manner. Through this platform we're trying to be a part of that process.</p>","The objective of my team is to use different web and media tools to present touristic, historical, cultural and other information about Bosnia and Herzegovina, the country of which the world knows very little. Traveling around the globe, from the USA to UAE, I noticed that BiH is quite inconspicuous and unknown, it's mostly recognizable by civil war fom 1992. till 1995.  With this interactive and transparent platform my team will try to change that image and to intrigue people to visit Bosnia.","Despite all this indescribable natural beauty, Bosnia and Herzegovina is still fairly unknown in the world and 20 years after the war most of people still recognize Bosnia only by war, which makes us very unhappy. I must stress that in the past years we've been trying to get some help, financial and other, from our authorities at the state and local level, but all we got was declarative support and promises. It is time to change that.","I gathered a team of top professionals, who have a great experience on television and in the development of web applications and design, so our duty is to create manageable, visible, interactive platform in which we will present news, data, statistics, history, culture, cuisine, architecture, natural beauties and diversity of attractions and all those things that can be available, interesting, usefull and informative to people all around the globe.","This multifunctional and interactive platform will allow people around the world to adopt diverse knowledge of this small European country and to share them in their communities (families, companies, schools ...). By increasing their knowledge about Bosnia they will contribute to the creation of a new chapter in the development and future of this country.","1.

                </p>",ElectionsAi: Media Sentiment Data Analysis for Empowering the Electorate,"Advanced Sentiment Data Analysis Platform for Monitoring Media Coverage of Political Campaigns for National, State, and Local Elections","<p>Media coverage shapes our understanding and opinion of political figures, campaign issues and elections. When the election season heats up, hundreds of articles are published daily about candidates running for political office, analyzing their statements and positions on various policy issues. It is a well-known fact that news coverage comes with implicit and explicit biases that are based on the media outlet's political orientation. Given the limited time we all have, most of us might read an article or two from a media source we trust and passively let that media source shape our views of candidates. However with advances in technology, it is now possible to address this problem by leveraging smart algorithms that analyze the tone and sentiment of media coverage across hundreds of news articles from different political orientations. </p>","ElectionsAi uses a novel context-rich sentiment analysis algorithm to provide citizens with an easy overview of how thousands of media articles across the political spectrum are covering candidates' election campaigns, their policy stances and their stories.","We believe that in order for any democracy to thrive and reach its full potential, the electorate needs to be well-informed and aware of media biases in coverage of election campaigns. ElectionsAi tries to address this need by leveraging sentiment analysis to empower citizens to transition from passive targets of media feeds to active, holistically informed, and bias-aware participants in their media consumption.","We have successfully developed a working prototype <a href=""http://www.electionsai.com"" target=""_blank"">http://www.electionsai.com</a> that processes sentiment data from thousands of news articles on political campaigns. However this is just the start. We need to significantly improve our back-end technology and the quality and accuracy of the sentiment analysis engine. We also need to create an attractive, easy to use and interactive web and mobile user interface that will allow community-building &amp; idea sharing.","A successful outcome would be for ElectionsAi to empower millions of news consumers in the English-speaking world (hope to expand to other languages), to be informed voters and participants in democratic elections. A secondary outcome would be for less visible media sources to become more accessible to the average user through our holistic coverage of hundreds of outlets.","Ali Mostashari, Ph.D.  (Skills: Complex Sociotechnological Systems, Public Policy, Knowledge Management and Technology-enabled Participatory Democracy.)<br>Mario Storga, Ph.D. (Skills: Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Graph-based Context Clustering)<br>Ivan Gavran  (Skills: Software Development, Software Architecture and Application Development)<br>Antonio Magdic (Skills: Front-end and UI Development and Responsive Applications)<br>Keyvan Firouzi (Skills: Operations and Outreach)","Vizp(ren) is located in New York City and the reach of the project is currently the English-speaking world.

                </p>",Countdown to 2 Degrees Clock - Public Installations and Companion Website,The Countdown 2° Clock will bring the big data of climate change and the conversation into public spaces.,"<p>Climate change is one of the most pressing environmental challenges that we currently face, and yet few people understand the scale of the challenge, or the urgency to act. One of the primary reasons for this is that people cannot relate to the science of climate change and the data it produces. The problem is too vast and the data to impersonal to easily understand. Even though people are reminded everyday through the media about the impacts of climate change, the problem is so global that it is very difficult to understand and visualize how the temperature rising a few degrees will actually affect our planet and our lives in any real way. Similarly it is difficult to connect the global challenge to decrease and eventually eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, with individual decisions related to behaviours that produce these emissions. Local actions are key to solving the climate problem, and yet it is easy for these actions to appear insignificant against the global effort to decrease emissions. Widespread global adoption of clean energy and the elimination of fossil fuels at the scale of nations and large corporation is of course ultimately necessary to achieve deep carbon reductions, and many individual people feel helpless or unsure how to act in the face of this challenge. Too often, we respond by ignoring the problem, relegating it to an abstract concept that we know intellectually to be a problem, but that does not carry enough urgency to make us begin to act.</p>","We are creating public installations that use state-of-the-art climate data to show the ever present urgency of climate change, beginning with a Countdown to 2 Degrees clock and companion website where people can visualize in real time the link between global greenhouse gas emissions, increasing temperatures, and the time remaining to 2 degrees of global warming.The annual resetting of the clock will become a media event - a symbolic indicator of our progress towards meeting the 2 degree target.","We want to highlight in a clear and compelling way the best available scientific data, so as to make climate change a permanent part of the public conversation. By installing and resetting the clock annually, we will emphasize the urgency to act on climate change, and will give people a way to clearly see progress towards the goal of avoiding 2 degrees of global warming.","We have assembled the team that can collect and interpret the data, build the clock and the companion interactive website. <br>Presently we are experimenting and wireframing different possible visualizations for the clock and exploring what form it should take.<br>We secured the first 3 locations that will display the clock.<br>1.

Although traditionally based on sand, sea and sun, as the global tourism landscape evolves, there is an emerging market for an alternative tourism product that is heritage-, cultural- or nature-based and thrives on visitor-community interaction, exploration and exchange. This so-called community-based tourism creates opportunities for empowering local communities as sustainable businesses, by developing, marketing and exposing their natural culture, talents, passion and potential to the world and is a key component of Jamaica’s sustainable tourism future.</p>",The project will combine official government open data with crowdsourced interactive map data and indigenous content produced in local communities to enhance the visibility and inclusiveness of community tourism in Jamaica.,"The Tourism sector in the Caribbean faces  some systemic challenges, including the dominance of the sector by large properties. Small operators  have an inherent disadvantage due to lack of financial resources, organizational capabilities and visibility. Indirect consequences of this marginalization includes high leakage rates and diminished linkages with other sectors in the domestic economy. Participatory community tourism can help to create a more sustainable tourism sector.","Our prior research identified Community Based Tourism as a unique setting for a bottom-up, demand-driven Open Data Initiative, that engages the local actors in the community as major contributors to the production and publishing of open data and indigenous content that could become a catalyst for participatory economic development. This proposal evaluates this “theory of change” and we have engaged key stakeholders in 3 potential target communities and various public agencies.about collaboration","Successful outcomes would include:<br>- production of media-rich community map artifacts, through the effective engagement, capacity-building &amp; empowerment of local community participants<br>- establishment of an effective map-based open data platform that provides Innovation opportunities for software developers and other tourism service entrepreneurs<br>- demonstrate the use of Open Data to  augment, scale and increase relevance of interactive community mapping initiatives in a developing context","Dr. Maurice McNaughton, Project Lead, Director, Centre of IT-enabled Innovation, Mona School of Business &amp; Management (MSBM)<br>Dr. Michelle McLeod, Lecturer/Researcher, MSBM - Specialist in Tourism Knowledge Networks and Social Network Analysis <br>Several university student interns for support field research, community mapping, and software development",3 local communities in Jamaica.

The public and elected officials need access to neutral, integrated, and understandable information on water issues in order to make informed decisions.","The Open Water Foundation was founded in 2013 to focus on improved data access and increased transparency on complex water issues.  We have led an effort to leverage software that was developed to study complex issues, including tools to access web services, and helping Colorado move software to open source licensing.  We have made good progress on the technological framework and education about open data and software for civic collaboration on water issues.","Colorado is facing important water issues including how to supply water to cities, agriculture, industry, and the environment as population increases and climate change and drought increase scarcity.  The project will be successful if we can help the public understand multiple perspectives on complex issues with integrated data.  We want to provide a rich data and software platform that allows issues to be considered as an integrated system, rather than singular issues lacking in context.","The team includes Open Water Foundation staff.  Steve Malers, Founder, CTO, and Systems Engineer with over 20 years developing and applying software tools for water resources.  Amy Volckens, Water Resources Engineer with over 10 years of experience analyzing complex water issues.  Catherine Lane, Software Engineer with over 20 years of experience developing water resources software and web applications.  Louann DeCoursey, CEO with focus on social impact investing.","The issues that we are addressing are important to Colorado, in particular high population growth areas along the Front Range, where competition for water resources will be highest.  Urban areas are increasingly using water supplies that have previously been used for agriculture and environmental flows.  Because Colorado is a headwaters state, water issues in Colorado also impact all downstream states, in particular those depending on the Colorado River (AZ, CA, NV, NM, UT, WY, and Mexico)."

With the phones they already have and a free downloadable app, dozens of smart phone reporters per community can collect and contribute data and video to the information machine. They know best what issues affect them, their family, neighbors and friends. As city governments make more data publicly available, the our citizen reporters can access and explain its relevance to their lives. Our smart phone reporters and other journalist can use tools like the Knight Foundation funded OpenBlock code to truly empower every citizen with real time data and hyper-localized analysis. It is ""trickle up"" information and engagement.

In our project, we explore how to contribute to this collaborative effort through new methods of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education aimed at exploring environmental sustainability through citizen science and social media. We investigate how citizen science can be understood through social media, where participating in scientific processes can become part of middle and high school student’s digitally enabled social lives.

The city’s surplus of storefront and other commercial vacancies is both a cause and effect of  decreased foot traffic, specifically within the once booming downtown area.</p>",We're creating a web application to connect property owners and entrepreneurs to ease business development by optimally pairing new businesses with vacant properties.,There are many vacant storefronts in Trenton that make the area look unappealing. New business owners don’t want to rent in Trenton because they lack confidence in Trenton locations and they don’t have access to good information. Our application will bridge this information gap and make the Trenton area more appealing to new businesses.,"The Trenton Downtown association has collected a great deal of data on vacant properties in Trenton and have developed a website through their Trenton Neighborhood Restoration Campaign, <a href=""http://www.restoringtrenton.org"" target=""_blank"">http://www.restoringtrenton.org</a>/. Our application will build on this data, providing a user interface that filters and organizes the data specifically for prospective business owners and entrepreneurs in a streamlined and user friendly manner.",Our successful outcome is to reduce vacancies by at least 10% of current inventory by 2020. We'll also educate entrepreneurs on how and where to start a business in the Trenton area to streamline the business development process. The website will also create a platform for efficiently matching property owners and new businesses.

In this project, we try to burst these filter bubbles by (i) Informing users about their news consumption, by quantifying biases in information that they receive, (ii) Try to nudge users towards a healthy news diet by recommending news from the 'other' side too, so that they have a holistic view of a topic.","Filter bubbles are very important to understand and counter as they might have adverse affects on main stream politics, decision making and societal life in general.<br><br>They can lead to users receiving biased information, which can foster intolerance to opposing viewpoints which in turn leads to ideological segregation and antagonisms in main stream political issues.<br><br>Minority voices might be suppressed if a small number of media sources have the power to influence public opinion.","We were able to successfully show how information sharing on Twitter for controversial topics is clearly polarized and proposed methods to quantify this polarization. We applied our techniques 'in the wild' on Twitter, and were able to correctly identify controversial topics automatically. Using our methods for measuring controversy, we were able to measure how biased a user is, in terms of his social media activity, thus allowing us to present news from the 'other' side to the user.","Bursting online filter bubbles and creating a healthy news diet for a user has many applications. Apart from the benefits at a societal level mentioned above, our methods have practical applications which can be integrated into real-world news aggregation systems, such as Google news.

As a result, the public, regulatory agencies and policymakers, often have little information about building energy use in their regions and across the state. The Energy Data Center (EDC) would serve as a library for the state’s building energy data and would be free and accessible to the public, aggregated to protect individual customer privacy. This would allow for independent, public-interest research that pulls together new data in innovative ways that is not possible under existing conditions. An organized, secure, statewide Energy Data Center linking consistent, regularly updated energy data from across the state with building, land use, climate, socio-demographic, and other information is an integrated solution that could meet the needs of multiple stakeholders including ratepayers, privacy experts, energy planners, policy makers, the state Public Utilities Commission and the state’s Energy Commission. Ultimately, the EDC will help fine-tune legislation that reduces greenhouse gas emissions in the built environment, addresses climate change impacts, and will concretely create a more sustainable and healthy California. </p>","Creating a library of statewide building energy use is the first step to filling a critical gap in the state’s understanding and policymaking in the fields of energy sustainability, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from a sector that emits 40% of city GHGs, improving green infrastructure, new technologies and practices.","The EDC will provide data about actual building energy use by age of building, square foot, per capita, and median use of the building. To date, policy has been operating on modeled, sampled or self-reported data with no baselines of performance tracked over time. We know very little about real buildings anywhere. This data is critical for the state to wisely transform building energy use to meet the challenges of GHG emissions and increased urban heat impacts from climate change.","We have obtained nine years of billing data for LA County through non-disclosure agreements with the state’s Public Utilities Commission and city utilities. We have developed an interactive web atlas that shows building energy use across the County (the most populous county in the U.S.). This falls short of establishing a real library for the whole state’s utility data and over time, for tracking energy use and studying what works to establish real understandings and improve building energy use.","An updated statewide building energy library housed at a public university that provides analysis to make buildings better places to work, live, and play. This is particularly important as climate change will increase the number of hot days in California’s cities. Better performing buildings that don’t need a lot of electricity to stay cool will be essential.

                    In the early 1990s, during his stormwater research for the EPA, Melton discovered that what we were hearing in the media about climate change was understating what climate scientists were saying in their academic findings. Climate change (in general) was actually worse than what the alarmist media had been telling us. By shortly after 2000 the disconnection grew so large that he began writing and speaking about climate change. In 2005 he had a publisher for his full color book on climate change—the first of its kind. The publisher would not do color however and his outreach training had taught him that color is tremendously important in communicating complicated science, so he turned them down. Six months later Al Gore published his full color An Inconvenient Truth, proving Melton’s book model but killing that  project. Melton knew he needed another hook, so he picked up his cameras and went to Greenland and deserted barrier islands and Alaska and the High Rockies and began filming and writing about climate changes happening now.  His climate change knowledge base now has about 400 reports on academic climate science work, about 50 popular press articles, two documentaries on climate changes already underway, a book about 42 recent, relatively unknown climate science discoveries and about three dozen blues, rock and folks songs written with climate issue lyrics. The films are somewhat experimental, focusing on reality based concepts and using songs with lyrics, played by Melton's band Climate Change, as a binding tie.

For instance, the gender bias against women pertaining to electronic inclinations and competencies can contribute to even lower level of representation and participation in electronic-based governance initiatives. The implications are more pronounced in smaller scale governing practices, such as community building and planning in local governments, where electronic participation of citizens in strategic planning process creates opportunities to practice forms of direct democracy in society. Consequently, it is imperative to ensure the outcomes of these initiatives are reflective of democratic values, not only through creating a level-playing field, but also addressing entrance barriers (e.g., optimizing information usability and user-friendliness for less technical population groups), and ultimately adopting practices that proactively extend and engage groups that are more prone to exclusion due to implications of digital divide in society. Such a comprehensive approach entails systematic collaboration of different stakeholders and parties in carefully designing every step of electronic participation initiatives, so that considerations for facets of information inequality and digital divide are embedded throughout the process in form of establishing and monitoring information standards; advertising initiatives that target information bias groups; and provision of policies in the makeup of group of participates to ensure a fair representation of the preferences and values of all groups in the community, among other remedies. Ultimately, the overarching goal of this project is to advocate strategies in setting a democratic foundation for increasingly emerging e-government initiatives by bringing information inequality and digital divide to the forefront of e-governance trend.</p>","The main idea behind this project is that by identifying barriers that deprive population groups from participating in electronic community planning initiatives equally, and further establishing channels and methods to encourage and maximize participation of groups prone to digital divide (i.e. women, lower income, less educated, senior citizens), the value choices derived from these initiatives- and ultimately integrated in planning- are reflective of all groups of population in community.","As local government increase their reliance on electronic engagement of citizens' value choices to allocate public resources in building and planning communities, it is imperative to ensure that information bias and lack of or poor information equity is not excluding income, gender, or race groups, and by extension, threatening the democratic values and practices.","To date, most common and best practices in remediating digital divide implications in electronic governance initiatives at local level have been researched. Additionally, an ecosystem map of contributing and collaborating players, such as watch dog organizations, NPOs, and community-based groups, is drafted. Please note that this project constitutes part of a dissertation requirement to fulfill a degree in Doctor of Philosophy in Public Administration.","The overarching outcome of this project is bringing the crucial issue of information inequality and considerations of methods and standards to address them systematicaly to the forefront of electronic governance initiatives, in general, and citizen electronic participation in community planning and resource allocation, in particular.

In current marketplaces, workers and requesters are often unable to trust each others’ quality, and their mental models of tasks are misaligned due to ambiguous instructions or confusing edge cases. This breakdown of trust typically arises from (1) flawed reputation systems which do not accurately reflect worker and requester quality, and from (2) poorly designed tasks. </p>","We are a group of five hundred designers, engineers, crowd workers, and crowd requesters from around the world who are building a better platform for crowd work (a la Mechanical Turk) that succeeds at respecting all parties through open governance, tight communication, and the tiniest dash of technical wizardry.","The computer no longer is just our tool for doing work: it is becoming an instrument that gives us work. As a result, an algorithm may be your next boss, or at least be your task matchmaker. Ask an Uber driver, who is told where to be and when by software. Or ask workers on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk marketplace, who execute information tasks for hours a day at piecework rates. We seek a community-created platform that, unlike those two, extends respect and trust to both workers and requesters.","We initiated a ""crowdsourced"" process at Stanford University, making an open call to anyone interested and ultimately drawing in over 500 participants. Months later, our community (professional software engineers, data scientists, a TR35 winner, ITP media graduates, high schoolers, and more) have produced a beta version and open-source software at <a href=""https://github.com/crowdresearch/crowdsource-platform"" target=""_blank"">https://github.com/crowdresearch/crowdsource-platform</a>. We want to extend the platform with support from workers and clients, iterate, and launch!","At the very least, we want to become an infrastructure and a beacon for future online work platforms that it's possible to do better. At the best, we want to gain tens of thousands of workers and requesters, and show by doing! Either way, we will be launching.<br><br>Along the way, as we design and iterate, we want to engage with hundreds more people in the design and research process.","Michael Bernstein, Assistant Professor of Computer Science, Stanford University<br>...and so many more collaborators that it can't even fit.

Dictionaries also often lack sufficient rich, real-world examples to allow users to learn words naturally, in context. Traditional dictionaries also make it difficult to access data about the lexicon for research or product development: often no API exists, or access is restricted, poorly-documented, and expensive.","Wordnik has some information about more than eight million words of English, and an API used by more than 16,000 developers.

I conceived of Live World late one night in Los Angeles when I was driving home and came upon a large police roadblock in the middle of the city. When I arrived home, I spent hours trying to find an accurate news story about what had happened. Finally, I stumbled upon a single Twitter post from a Los Angeles journalist giving a description of the incident. None of the digital news media covered the story, and I realized that local news within communities is being drowned out as news agencies consolidate.

Currently, information overload is compounded by irrelevant categorization, and location-based journalism is almost non-existent.

Live World addresses this need by providing a tool for people to browse, search and filter news for a specific geographic area.","We've completed an executive summary and have begun work on a business plan for Live World. A design document outlining solutions to the technical challenges and user experience is underway, and key technological partners have been identified.

And soon, schools will be paying players as well. </p>","The true costs of college athletics is secreted away in thousands of pages of documents that are difficult for reporters and the public to access. We'd like to build a machine learning framework to unlock these documents to build a publicly searchable app and allow taxpayers, students, parents and university communities to get a full accounting of how colleges spend money on athletics.","The true amount of money spent on athletics is difficult to determine, much of it veiled in coach and multi-media contracts that are rarely scrutinized. Increasingly, the money a school reports paying a coach is a small portion of their true salary, and unless consumers can track thousands of documents, finding the true amount of spending on athletics is nearly impossible, and schools have little incentive to be fully transparent.","Over the past 10 years we have collected and analyzed thousands of publicly-available documents that track athletics' spending -- all by hand. We have thousands more that have never been analyzed. We have a proven methodology, a refined collection system (with a network of more than 70 communities with colleges) and the experience. What we lack is scale. There are thousands of coaches, staff members and others -- not to mention other marketing and media spending -- that are barely examined.","1) Create a publicly available data trove of total salaries, spending and major revenue at more than 230 Division I public and -- eventually -- more than 800 smaller schools. That data is currently locked up in text and not reported by other means. It takes a level of expertise to understand the contracts, and scale to put them in context. <br>2) Create a tool that can be refined every year as language and contract clauses evolve.<br>3) Create a visualization to compare data on similar schools.","Jodi Upton: Reporter and Python, SQL and machine learning coder.

At the same time, and the City is committed to protecting the public’s personal information and recently launched its Privacy Program, establishing an ethical framework for how we collect, use, and maintain data. There is an inherent tension between making data openly available and protecting privacy – making too much data available openly can expose vulnerable populations, who tend to be over-represented in government data, to harm from those seeking to use data for predatory purposes. New technologies, such as body worn cameras for police officers are generating volumes of new data that cannot be reviewed with traditional data management techniques. We propose convening a symposium where cities can share their practices for navigating privacy and open data challenges, and engage in a dialogue on potential strategies for resolving common issues.

GDP is often used to measure prosperity, but it captures at best only the monetary aspect of well-being.  The quality of human relationships, trust in one’s neighbors and government, satisfaction with life, hope for one’s children, engagement at work, and a sense of meaning and accomplishment are all also crucial measures of quality of life and they are omitted from national accounts. Good measurements of the full range of types of well-being can help everyone from government and charities assessing their actions to individuals choosing where to live. Decisions on which candidate to vote for, where to volunteer, which neighborhood to buy a home in or where to open a local business are driven by more than economic prospects. Flourishing communities require engagement by people who care about each other; knowing where and how communities are -- or are not -- flourishing is key to making wise decisions both for those in power and for the rest of us. While traditional surveys can capture many of the important elements of a socio-economic portfolio, surveys are expensive, limited in scope and often impractical across large, diverse populations. Our language-based big data assessments, based on social media such as Twitter, can overcome many of these limitations.</p>","We propose a big data-driven live feed comprised of various dimensions of community well-being, such as happiness, trust and optimism, across cultures and languages based on social media, and disseminated via an interactive map; we hope that our insights and analyses will help individuals, organizations, and governments choose actions and policies that are not just in the best economic interest of the people or companies, but which truly improve their well-being.","Our endeavor addresses recent recommendations from economists, psychologists, and international organizations to move away from GDP and towards the assessment of psychosocial variables that determine a nation’s well-being. We hope that our insights and analyses will help individuals, organizations, and governments choose actions and policies that are not just in the best economic interest of the people or companies, but which truly improve their well-being.","We already have the basic infrastructure for the map in place, including language-based assessments of positive emotionality and meaning, as well as life satisfaction and public polling data for the US, and we are starting to build a similar well-being map for Spain. We are engaged in further research to develop a greater variety of important language-based variables, to produce more fine-grained resolution of the map, and to extend our language-based assessments to more languages and countries.","We hope our map will become a transparent tool to guide individuals and policy-makers.

                    Physicians for Human Rights, founded 30 years ago, is a global organization founded on the idea that health professionals, with their specialized skills, ethical duties, and credible voices, are uniquely positioned to stop human rights violations.  

PHR's investigations and expertise are used to advocate for the protection of persecuted health workers and medical facilities under attack, prevent torture, document mass atrocities, and hold those who violate human rights accountable.  

PHR is a Nobel Peace Prize co-laureate.

While it was clear to every Syrian living through the conflict that their government was systematically targeting the health care system in order to weaken the opposition and its civilian supporters, this information was not widely available outside of Syria and there was little international response to these attacks. </p>","Journalists, international policymakers, and NGOs need an upgraded, expanded, interactive Syria map with searchable and filterable data capabilities in order to target advocacy, promote solutions to the humanitarian and refugee crisis arising from the Syrian conflict, and support justice in a post-war Syria with rigorous documentation that can be used to prosecute perpetrators of war crimes.","NGOs, policymakers and journalists increasingly request our Syria data and complex analyses of attacks to support research, advocacy, and policy work. With more funds, we would meet their needs by:<br>• Hiring added field source documenters<br>•Translating the map into Arabic, adding search, filter, and analysis capabilities<br>•Producing more public reports analyzing the data<br>•Improving distribution and outreach to officials, journalists, NGOs (beyond the current 800) especially through social media","PHR has maintained the map since May 2014. We forged relationships with the Carter Center, Palantir, Geospatial Technologies, and Human Rights Project at the American Association for the Advancement of Science. We streamlined open source research methods and developed a network of medical personnel and documenters in Syria who are keen to document attacks. And, an extensive network of policymakers, NGOs, and journalists regularly use our documentation and want it tailored to their interests.","This project would be successful if PHR can revamp the online, interactive map to make it more user-friendly, increase the map’s “readership,” increase media coverage of attacks on health care in Syria, and increase advocacy aimed at ending attacks on health care in Syria and around the world. Success may look like:<br>•Increased discussion of and legislation protecting medical neutrality<br>•Increased coverage of the Syrian healthcare system crisis<br>•Increased traffic to the online map","Widney Brown, Director of Programs<br>Elise Baker: PHR Investigations Associate: two years documenting attacks on health care in Syria <br>Adrienne Fricke: PHR Syria Advisor: lawyer; Arabic language fluency; two years documenting attacks on health care in Syria <br>Health care workers in Syria with 4+ years documenting attacks on health care: field sources who must remain anonymous for safety reasons  <br>Interns: International students with Arabic language fluency","Physicians for Human Rights is headquartered in New York City, where most of the team is located.

Infrastructure works best when it is invisible, i.e. people expect to turn their water tap and have clean water come out of it. When infrastructure breaks down, consequences can range from irritating to dire, and often the complexity of infrastructure is misunderstood by citizens due to its invisibility.<br><br>In this project, we plan to train graduate students from the School of Information to work as interns for city governments in the state of Michigan to help create web and print tools that will help people understand the role of infrastructure, particularly when that infrastructure needs to be repaired or renovated. These materials, depending on the needs of individual cities, will include information visualization, information graphics, persuasive design, sensor networks, and information maps of infrastructure services.</p>","A program to help cites create information tools and services that use a combination of persuasive design, sensor networks, and interaction design to help people understand how physical infrastructure works in cities, and why it needs maintenance and renovation.","Much of the physical infrastructure in the United States is aging and needs major repair and reinvestment. For better or worse, infrastructure works best when it's invisible, and only becomes visible when it breaks down, which can have dire consequences.

From Ukraine to the US, citizens and journalists are increasingly choosing to livestream these events. But livestreams are often lost in a sea of media information, and when found are often little more than pixelated footage that is disconnected from larger narratives about the events being shown. DeepStream seeks to increase the usefulness this emergent form of information by creating a website that improves livestream search and viewing. By enabling search across multiple streaming platforms DeepStream helps you find the livestreams you want to watch faster. By gathering collections of livestreams into a single view and adding relevant blog posts, news stories, images, tweets, and other media to the live video, individuals or newsrooms can use DeepStream create highly informative, immersive, and interactive viewing experiences. Our goal is to build a platform that is a data-rich environment for learning about current events by connecting viewers to streamers in a way that emphasizes local perspectives and deeper engagement, while maintaining the experience of immediacy and authenticity that is an essential part of livestreaming.</p>","Our website will significantly improve the task of finding livestreams you want to watch by searching across multiple platforms at the same time, and makes watching ilvestreams much more informative and engaging by displaying user-selected information like news stories, blog posts, tweets, and images next to the live video.","Today, finding livestreams about important events is laborious and time consuming. People have to repeatedly search across multiple platforms or dig through busy twitter timelines in the hope of finding a needle in the media haystack. In addition, livestreams lack relevant data that can help people understand what they are watching and why it is important. These two problems reduce the effectiveness of livestreaming as an important data-gathering component for understanding world events.","To date we've done significant amounts of research and interviews to understand why people watch livestreams, how they find them, and what they do while watching. We've gone from early wireframe prototypes through multiple rounds of usability testing and redesign to arrive at a beautiful and intuitive user experience. And we've built the website, which is currently in private beta, implementing the major features discussed above.","A successful outcome for our project would be to establish our platform as an important source of real-time information about global events from local perspectives. We believe that livestreaming has not begun to reach its full potential as a source of information sharing, and that one way to tap into this potential is to combine the real-time perspective of people who are on the ground with curated data and information, so our goal is to change the way people watch live video.","Gordon Mangum, Research and Design.

The video interviews will form part of an interactive <em>Inspicio</em> app and website which will also serve as a repository for the footage.

The project will create connections between victims while identifying patterns of forgiveness across regions and cultures.","There are many instances of forgiveness. Yet, testimonies are forgotten after the immediate period following conflict resulting in a loss of historic memory. There is also a lack of understanding of the conditions that favor reconciliation and whether those could be replicated. Is reconciliation a necessary step to achieve peace?  PeaceLink  gives policymakers and peace activists the basis to answer these questions with data to justify their decisions, while connecting victims and communities.","We have established a network of 161 technology centers. These centers have become spaces where communities come together to share experiences, fears and expectations of what comes after conflict.  From this, we learned that technology enables reconciliation by inspiring a desire to connect with others and to share experiences beyond the physical boundaries of a particular town.","- An understanding of the conditions leading to reconciliation based on data collected from Peacelink, and a better policies designed based on such data<br>- Greater awareness by the general public of the fact that reconciliation is possible based on stories and data available on PeaceLink <br>- Entire communities where violence occurred, engaged in open conversations about forgiveness and post conflict, leading to healing and acceptance in those communities.

Sometimes when these agencies want to make the data in these systems public, they discover that they cannot easily get the data out of these systems. A vendor may even go so far as to claim that the vendor, not the government agency, owns the data. This notably occurred at the federal level when the U.S. Forest Service had to recreate it job descriptions database to switch vendors. Similarly, all of the data in the GSA's Federal Procurement Data System is owned by the vendor who operates the system (<a href=""https://fcw.com/articles/2014/09/16/who-owns-gov-data.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">source</a>). Or to take another example, many cities provide crime data to companies that allow the public to see the data on a map, but explicitly prohibit them from accessing the raw data feeds or scraping the data from the website (<a href=""http://recode.net/2014/05/05/is-your-citys-crime-data-private-property/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">source</a>).</p>","Providing local government officials information about whether commonly-used IT products support open data  will allow them to make better buying decisions, save taxpayers money, and encourage vendors to support open data through competition.","Many local government agencies have internal database systems that they use to collect important public information, such as restaurant health inspections, zoning complaints, building permits, police complaints, and more. One reason that local governments do not publish open data is that they are unable to get the data out of these internal databases, either because the vendor does not allow it or the vendor charges for access to the data.","We have already identified a number of systems that do not support open data, and we have begun to develop an assessment model for consistently evaluating different products.","Local governments would begin using our guide in their purchasing decisions so that they will know the extent to which the products they are buying support open data. In addition, by creating a more transparent market for these products, more vendors would begin to support open data efforts.","Daniel Castro is the director of the Center for Data Innovation, a think tank focusing on the intersection of data, technology, and public policy.

Government agencies at at all levels are required to release the documents in a reasonable time frame while ensuring that private data are not released. Most agencies rely on manual redaction to fulfill FOIA requests, which is costly, slow, and error-prone. Computer-assisted redaction can help.</p>","The Automated Redaction Tool (ART) uses advanced machine learning to find, flag, and remove sensitive information from documents automatically so governments can release public information more quickly and cheaply while maintaining privacy.","The FOIA process frustrates the government and citizens alike. Many government agencies have difficulty responding to the avalanche of FOIA requests they receive, sometimes leading to extremely long delays in response or no response at all. FOIA officers spend a great deal of time and energy combing through documents to ensure that personally identifying information is not disclosed, while citizens wait for the information they need. In some cases, litigation ensues, costing both sides money.","We have a prototype that works on Word documents and is described in Cumby and Ghani (2011). The system described here uses a machine learning approach, where text is classified as sensitive or not while maintaining the utility of the text. This system allows for the redaction of sensitive and personally identifying information, including credit card, social security, and account numbers; birthdates; names; locations; and organizations.","A successful system would be one that is 1) simple to use and 2) interactive and adaptive, enabling users to correct wrong redactions.

Considerable research documents the benefits of exposure to nature and open, green space, yet little data exists to create even a baseline of the natural resources we must preserve and enhance.","In 2010, by mapping the startling disparity in available greenspace acreage between our neighborhood and others in St Paul, we strengthened our case for a new, city-owned, 13 acre park in Frogtown. Similarly, relying on data provided by city foresters in 2011, we have addressed a neighborhood shortage of tree canopy, by planting over 150 new donated shade trees on private land. In 2014 we began a hydrological assessment of appropriate spaces for wetland restoration to bring back our totem:frogs.","Success would be, first, a planning document that gave equal weight to the ways in which Frogtown residents can benefit from a healthy, enhanced and preserved natural environment.

Already, IAVA has collected data from nearly 2,000 members, showing that 74% were exposed to burn pits and 47% have symptoms associated with exposure.","Success will be defined by an increase in awareness among veterans and families about the burn pit issue (measured by our member survey and other tools); an increase in media coverage; at least 2,000 IAVA members sharing their stories; at least 1,000 IAVA members signing up for the VA Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry; and referrals of everyone who shares their stories  to IAVA’s Rapid Response Referral Program, to ensure access to healthcare at the VA or through private services.","Jackie Maffucci, Research Director, has BS and PhD degrees.

Some content and supplemental data will come from community conversations about democracy and voting in local restaurants and bars in the public engagement portion of the venture.</p>","The Democracy on Tap App will make civic engagement interesting and encourage voter registration and turn-out among younger populations, ages 18-35, through interactive tools and personalized concerns drawn from data that will evolve with the user over time.","Many Wichita citizens are under-engaged and disconnected from the issues that shape the community. In 2014 just over half of the county’s registered voters went to the polls. Among voters between 18 and 29 years old only 21 percent cast ballots. At a time when citizens face monumental choices on the issues and people that will define their future, KMUW is uniquely suited as a news source and multi-media platform to facilitate the use of data as a productive tool in the democratic process.","KMUW has established the program Engage ICT: Democracy on Tap to convene important conversations in familiar public venues. A companion app will draw upon data on education, taxes and government and increase the impact exponentially. We have purchased the domain name <a href=""http://www.votewichita.com"" target=""_blank"">http://www.votewichita.com</a>.

Yet public opinion polls routinely leave out young voices, and particularly the voices of young people of color. For example, much of the news over the past year has focused on negative interactions between police and young black Americans, but few news outlets or survey units have taken the initiative to survey Black and Latino young people to explore their political attitudes on policing and violence. To more effectively address some of the most serious issues facing the U.S., we must survey the constituencies these issues most directly affect, often young people of color.  </p>","We are developing a new data project that includes a custom survey panel that will measure and monitor the political attitudes, experiences, and actions of Black, Latino, White and Asian-American citizens ages 18-30, and will share our data with a group of young journalists, analysts, commentators, and videographers who will write about our findings.","Many of today’s most pressing political issues—education, gun violence, mass incarceration, immigration, and the right to vote—disproportionately affect Black and Latino youth. Yet their voices are largely absent from news, policy debates, and research. Record numbers of young people voted to elect the first black president, yet interest in and participation among young voters has since waned, and as we approach the 2016 election, many young citizens are politically disengaged.","Black Youth Project (BYP) began as a national survey research project in 2005, and has since grown ito (1) produce research about underrepresented youth and their political and civic engagement; (2) amplify the uncensored perspectives of young people; and (3) encourage civic engagement and media literacy among young people of color. BYP conducts quarterly national surveys. Recent media pickup includes MSNBC, CNN, NPR, and the NYTimes. The BYP website has an average of 3,000 daily unique users.","This project will be a success when the voices of young people of color are amplified in the 2016 election, their policy preferences are debated seriously and, through our partnership with AP-NORC, our data is widely picked up by the media. Similarly, if presidential debates include questions that reflect the perspectives of young adults of color, and young people are included among debate panel questioners and pundits then we have had an impact.","Cathy J.

As a Collaborative, schools will work together to realize the unique, advanced benefits of big education data analysis.","We have support from half of all DC charter schools as well as DC Public Schools to help form the Collaborative.

Sentic technology combines sentiment and semantic analysis with machine learning to create embryonic forms of artificial intelligence capable of assessing online social data and making decisions based on specific criteria. Journ-O-Matic will be primarily designed to analyse large amounts of online social data in order to aid editorial or journalistic judgement in community or local news media. As a result, it will enable the production of hyperlocal alternative news agendas that will inform of often-overlooked news topics, thus encouraging civic deliberation and participation.</p>","Journ-O-Matic uses state-of-the-art sentiment analysis technology to process social data, and suggests what events have the potential to become news, and their priority in the running order.","In our local area, Stirling, we have in excess of 20 community newspapers that are exemplary in fulfilling the essential role of reflecting the community’s identity and activities. If we could benefit community news by democratising data technology currently only accessible to news corporations, then we could contribute to nurturing a better informed, more participative, plural, and local political citizenry.","Stirling's Cognitive Signal Image &amp; Control Processing Research (COSIPRA) Laboratory has developed multimodal sentic computing technology able to analyse facial expressions, speech and text to identify sentiments and emotions. Through a set of novel computational techniques, the sentic engines are capable to extending the current natural language text-based sentiment analysis to a multimodal emotion and sentiment analysis by mining opinions from product reviews in video, sound or text format.","Although this project, if successfully funded, foresees the development and implementation of Journ-O-Matic over a period of three years, for us these stages would be only the beginning of its life cycle.

It suffers from serious problems: no proper infrastructure, overcrowding, and poverty.

Accurate, concise information will be crucial in the upcoming years for citizens, businesses and legislators to make knowledgeable decisions. NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) Foundation’s electronic communication channels are popular information resources. Our website hosts thousands of pages devoted to the issue, but we see a need to centralize information into a single entity where data can be combined, personalized, customized and disseminated. </p>","Developed and managed by The NORML Foundation, the Marijuana Law Research Tool will be a web accessible, customizable, and publishable data utility leading to a more informed and active electorate. It will contain information covering state and federal legislators’ activities, marijuana laws, arrest data, news, analysis and current legislation related to marijuana. It will be available for anyone to use and share.","In 1970, approximately 12% of the US population supported legalization, today, over 50% of Americans support it.  In Congress, up until about 2010, there were one or two marijuana-related reform bills introduced annually. Today, there are over twenty cannabis regulation bills before Congress and nearly two dozen state legislatures are debating it. <br><br>With marijuana laws changing at an ever increasing rate the need for accessible, factual information is greater than ever.","The NORML Foundation’s website and social media are  popular destinations for concise and influential marijuana law news, information and analysis.

However, there is no global data access endpoint that enables readers to get answers to their queries. Most often, the answer to a reader's query is contained in data that is distributed over multiple sources, often in different formats and with different data schemas and vocabularies. In such cases, data integration is necessary to provide integrated access to multiple, heterogeneous data sources, giving readers the ease of a single, homogeneous database that caters to their needs.</p>","In our model, data driven articles would have interactive widgets that allow readers to tap into and explore the underlying structured data to gain different, potentially new insights. These widgets would be powered using the data integration service called Xardis that we are developing at Stanford. Xardis harmonizes underlying structured data from different sources with potentially different formats into one cohesive system.","Currently, data-driven articles provide merely a static, rigid view of data. This creates a disconnect between the readers and the underlying content. E.g. U.S. News and World Report publishes college rankings based on a fixed set of performance indicators. Since, no single formula can appropriately capture everyone’s interests, these rankings are not truly representative. Instead, if readers were allowed to interact with the underlying data, they could freely rank schools by their own criteria.","-Already deployed a functional version of Xardis at <a href=""http://www.xardis.com"" target=""_blank"">http://www.xardis.com</a>. <br>-Currently, Xardis contains factoids about people and organizations in the all the 3 branches of the U.S. government (federal, state and local) and supports a basic form driven query interface that supports queries such as ""Which department heads attended the same school as Barack Obama"" and ""Which senators are also board members of a company"". <br>-Developed Logiform, a tool to build Correct-on-Capture validation forms.","We would deem the following as successful outcomes: <br>- Expand the current knowledge base of Xardis to include in-depth factoids about corporations and schools in the U.S.<br>- Make Xardis' search and navigation interface more expressive without sacrificing user-friendliness. This would lead to better interactive widgets in data-driven articles.   <br>- Creating a writer/journalist-friendly editor that allows them to inject new factoids into Xardis, export Xardis factoids and embed Xardis widgets.","Sudhir Agarwal: PostDoc, Dept. of Computer Science, Stanford University <br>Michael Genesereth: Associate Professor, Dept. of Computer Science, Stanford University and Director, CodeX<br>Abhijeet Mohapatra: Ph.D. candidate, Dept. of Computer Science, Stanford University<br>Nicole Shanahan: lawyer, founder and CEO of ClearAccessIP an integrated patent management technology<br>Roland Vogl: Executive Director of the Stanford Program in Law, Science and Technology and Lecturer in Law, Stanford Law School","This project is a joint collaboration between the Computer Science Department at Stanford University and CodeX, the Stanford Center for Legal Informatics. <br><br>Location: Stanford University, Stanford CA - 94305."

                </p>",BallotBoost,Democratizing election data and endorsements for a new generation,"<p>Current voter education tools assume that it is possible and desirable to build a centralized and unbiased database for helping people decide how to vote. We believe that such a resource is probably impossible to build, maintain, and scale for local elections, where data on candidates and races is spotty or nonexistent. More importantly, we think that even if this resource existed for the tens of thousands of local races across the country, most people wouldn’t use it. We believe that what will inspire young people to vote and vote with confidence are specific, location-based voting data and recommendations from people they know and trust.</p>","BallotBoost lets you see voting recommendations from people you know and trust – and share your own recommendations – in the lead-up to elections. We connect people with relevant voting recommendations, educate uninformed voters, and give engaged citizens an unprecedented platform to expand their influence and amplify their impact.","A 2015 Knight study revealed that the main obstacle preventing young people from voting is a lack of information. They don’t feel informed enough to vote wisely so they don’t vote at all. At the same time, a series of recent studies show that friends and social media have a much larger impact on young people’s voting decisions than traditional sources of voter info. BallotBoost closes the knowledge gap by providing a platform for people to inform and inspire each other around the act of voting.","We’ve spent recent months researching the voter education space and the existing players, identifying gaps and opportunities, speaking with foundations, connecting with experts and potential advisers, and developing this vision for a sustainable and crowdsourced voter education platform that can cover elections at every level of government. Our approach has evolved substantially since submitting another election education idea last March (Glassbooth: <a href=""http://goo.gl/jjU40t"" target=""_blank"">http://goo.gl/jjU40t</a>).","- Inspire more people, especially young people, to vote in local elections<br>- Build a tool that enters the public conservation around voting (e.g. “Confused about how to vote?

Yet despite spending so much time on these devices, smartphone users have a very limited sense of what it means to install an app that requests specific permissions. It makes sense for an app like Uber or Lyft to access location data when a user needs a ride. But as was reported recently, Uber also accesses a user's contact list with the intention of using that information to send <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/23/technology/uber-data-collection-changes-should-be-barred-privacy-group-urges.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">marketing promotions to the user's contacts</a>; to the user installing Uber, this is primarily presented as “This app has access to Contacts.” There are essential questions to answer: how are popular apps behaving? Are the companies behind these applications disclosing usage details? Are users making an informed decision about their privacy when they install a smartphone application? </p>","The Electronic Frontier Foundation plans to analyze the code and behavior of the most popular smartphone apps to determine how data is being accessed and transmitted in relation to the permissions required by the app, and to make this information accessible to consumers, researchers, journalists, and technologists.","The average person has no way to know how apps behave on their devices, and what personal information is being accessed, and when. The “all or nothing” nature of app permissions stifles inquiry, and distances users from knowing the privacy risks associated with a given application. We will create a resource detailing the extent of data collected as a reference for smartphone users, and publish the specifics of our methods and findings to help others investigate app policies and practices.",Work has not commenced on this project yet.,"This project seeks to jumpstart momentum towards a range of solutions by improving awareness among the public, paving the way for journalists to investigate company policies and practices around the data collected through smartphone apps, demonstrating to smartphone platform providers—like Apple and Google—that privacy and app permissions must be improved for users, and inspiring greater accountability for app developers.","Staff Technologist Noah Swartz works on software that EFF produces and maintains, including Privacy Badger.

We have identified social media data to be a viable way of conducting real time assessment of public opinion and sentiment.,"We have already developed data collection technology and algorithms with the ability to scan and “data-mine” information related to public discussion in social media.  In our prior published work, we developed a “semantic ontology” and a text-mining framework to analyze and aggregate local and national news from digital reports for several countries in the world.  We gauged the mood of the country as well as assessed the positive and negative sentiments concerning key factors.","Summary metrics also will provide a snapshot of public opinion on relevant topics.  Better still, by moving to an open source platform, people around the world will be positioned to leverage our work to derive the same insight no matter what the issue or where the location.  If people are posting online, our system will make transparent public sentiment and not only provide feedback on the health of their local community but potentially foster more open conversation about ways to improve it.","Suchi Gopal is a professor at BU whose research interest includes data mining, neural networks, and GIS.

There should be no doubt whatever about that. We live in a society that is constantly generating vast quantities of personal information, which in turn is tracked, screened, and sorted by corporations and the government. Ad networks monitor our web-surfing to send us more relevant ads. The NSA screens our emails for signs of radicalism. Schools track student sleep and activity patterns. CCTV cameras guard every street corner and traffic light, and drones are starting to appear in our skies. We’re even tracking ourselves, using personal electronics like GPS watches, fitness trackers, and other gadgets that make the “quantified self” a realistic possibility.</p>","I plan to write a short, readable book for the general public that explains why privacy rules that protect our hard-won civil liberties and consumer protection rights will be essential to ensure our digital society does not put technology ahead of people. This is one of the most important challenges of our times, and one in which good ideas, simply and clearly stated, will be essential.","We talk about privacy all the time, but we have little idea what we mean by ""privacy."" At the same time, the dangerous meme of The Death of Privacy is used to short-circuit our discussions as a society about how we should use personal data (and how we should not). I am planning to create and publicize a clear and accessible account of what privacy means in a digital age and why it matters.","My first book, Intellectual Privacy (OUP 2015) identified how privacy is essential if we want to give new, potentially controversial, ideas the room they need to breathe. Earlier this year, I published an essay, Four Privacy Myths, that debunks four of the most common myths we hear in the ways we talk about privacy in our daily lives and in public. (It is available here: <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2427808"" target=""_blank"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2427808</a>).","Success would be changing the way the public thinks about privacy in our age of data; it would be abolishing lazy talk about the ""Death of Privacy,"" and it would be providing guidance for the ways that our laws, social norms and technologies interact with personal information. Success would require the publication of a short, readable book about Why Privacy Matters, and publicizing its ideas through a wide variety of conventional and new media.","Neil Richards (me). I am a Professor of Law at Washington University, an affiliate scholar at Stanford and Yale Law Schools, and a Trustee of the Freedom to Read Foundation. I have almost two decades' experience in thinking and working on issues of privacy and technology, and in communicating my ideas to a public audience as well as an academic one.","Saint Louis, Missouri."

                </p>",Data And Journalism Working Together With NewsNav And Silk,NewsNav and Silk provide news workers with the tools and technology they require to build self-sustaining journalism enterprises.,"<p>The problem this project deals with is what happens when a negative feedback loop interferes with economy, business, jobs, and (in this instance) journalism quality and news reporting. People lose jobs and newspapers go under because audience bundles and advertising bundles have been severed by the Internet.</p>",This is a team effort aimed at creating an online news publishing model hitherto not contemplated or tried.,"Nobody to date has figured out how to eliminate online pay walls and side step the news business disruption created by technology on the one hand and the absence of appropriate business models on the other hand.  This combined project proposal from NewsNav and Silk  will hopefully get noticed by  online news workers, as well as newspapers willing to experiment with our model, build on the things we succeed at, and learn from our mistakes.","The attached PowerPoint slide deck says (more or less) everything that needs to be clarified as to whether NewsNav and Silk are ready-to-go enterprises that have already leveraged the skill sets and experience of the joint venture partners. To progress this model we need to generate interest from unemployed or under-employed journalists, as well as online news entities, large and small, to continue experimenting and innovating with the project after our funding runs out.","Two things: First, the NewsNav and Silk partnership will be successful if we can motivate, mentor and train a group of unemployed or underemployed journalists by providing the dual tools they require to succeed as startup journalist/entrepreneurs. Second, if we can do that successfully, and with additional assistance from the online editions of newspapers, it is possible that this experimental venture will transform into an ongoing business that generates business revenue and news innovation.",There are two principal members of the team. We are looking for other team members. Frederick Harris is the visionary and NewsNav network creator and author of this proposal. Alex Salkever is the marketing and technology guru with help from a technical cohort at Silk in San Franscisco. Our respective profiles are available at LinkedIn. We have both worked in journalism.

There is now an increasing flood of overhead imagery from new satellite companies, drones, DIY balloons, and <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/watch-this-guy-troll-london-with-a-super-long-selfie-st-1690150677"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">really long selfie sticks</a>. These images hold tremendously powerful information about issues such as the effects of climate change, environmental abuses by corporations, and damage caused by natural disasters. However, much of this potential information is not exploited. Satellite and drone imagery is still incredibly hard to work with. Most communities don’t have the expensive software or expertise required to work with imagery.</p>",We are building the Wikipedia for drone and satellite imagery. And we are building highly usable tools for people to make use of this imagery.,"Overhead imagery is quickly moving to be widely and democratically available. There is an opportunity to make imagery participatory. Individuals will not only consume the satellite imagery in their mapping app, but they can also capture their own imagery and share it. To do this will require investment in infrastructure -- an open commons for imagery and tools that make this data accessible, useful, and enjoyable to individuals and communities.","We built a beta version of OpenAerialMap that solves a lot of the hard problems around data storage and browsing. But there is still no way for people to upload data directly to OpenAerialMap. Their imagery must be stored in a location before it is made available. Once a user finds imagery on OpenAerialMap it is still hard for them to do anything with it. People cannot sign up for alerts for new imagery in their community, or easily share interesting imagery with their network.",Finding imagery is as easy as Google image search. Publishing imagery is as easy as Blogger. Analyzing imagery is as easy as doing basic math on a calculator.,"The OpenAerialMap community involves a range of humanitarian and technology actors. Core to the effort have been the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, an open community of mappers that responds to humanitarian crises, and Development Seed, an open data group that builds powerful tools for mapping and imagery processing. Development Seed builds tools like the iD editor, a highly usable and popular tool for editing OpenStreetMap.",Washington DC / International

Right now, with best available data, it's actually impossible to know.  But we can fix it...","<p>Data measures some people, and some places, better than others. This is especially true of the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS). In 2010 the ACS replaced the long form of the decennial census as the principal source for geographically detailed information about the population and economy of the United States. The ACS produces estimates for thousands of variables at a variety of geographic scales, the smallest of which (the block group) divides the US like a jigsaw puzzle into 217,740 pieces. The ACS data are terribly imprecise. For some policy-relevant variables, like the number of children in poverty, the estimates are almost unusable — in the 2007–2011 ACS, of the 56,204 tracts for which a poverty estimate for children under 5 was available, 40,941 (72.8%) had a margin of error greater than the estimate. For example, the ACS indicates that Census Tract 196 in Brooklyn, New York has 169 children under 5 in poverty ± 174 children, suggesting that somewhere between 0 and 343 children in the area live in poverty.</p>",A web-based platform that brings neighborhood data into focus by dramatically reducing the margin of error in the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey.,"The best available federal data on neighborhoods in the US has enormous margins of error. For many variables it is common to find margins of error that are greater than the estimate itself, for example, a poverty rate of 15% +/- 20%. Our surveys and focus groups suggest that most data users ignore the margin of error when working with census data, which is very problematic! We are a team of academics who can reduce this margin and make census data more usable.","In 2015, we published an open-source algorithm in the leading international open-access scientific journal and on Github. Our method is technically sound and has undergone rigorous peer review. We've presented our work at the National Academy of Sciences. The method itself has been disseminated in the academic literature and validated.","We envision developing a simple web-based tool that will allow communities to refine data from the ACS by reducing the margin of error, thereby ""focusing data"" by removing the fuzziness caused by large margins of error. Our web based tool/platform will have three principal functions:  1) Education. 2)  Tools: Allow people to “fix” the margin of error in ACS data using a simple web-interface.  3) Access: A REST API that allows access to ""focused"" neighborhood level data.","David Folch is a geographer who studies the data &amp; algorithms that underlie empirical research &amp; public policy decisions.<br>Seth Spielman is Geographer and Data Scientist who has held positions in industry &amp; at Columbia University, Brown University, &amp; University of Colorado.  <br>Owen Mundy is a researcher and technologist who investigates public space, information privacy, &amp; big data.<br>Carson Farmer is Geographic Information Scientist who works on algorithms &amp; models for large geographic datasets.","Boulder, Colorado; Talahassee, FL; Cupertino, CA"

This 360 degrees view of the subject will contribute to better and more comprehensive dialogue between government, NGOs and the public and generate comprehensive solutions to complex public problems.","Information on any given subject in the public discourse is partial and most issues are presented in a partial way, from one viewpoint or in a distorted way. There is little exchange of information and data between different stakeholders such as government, NGOs and clients (the public) about specific issues. As a result issues are fragmented, it is easy for interested parties to distort public opinion and comprehensive solutions for public problems rarely emerge.",We identified several public issues and contacted leading NGOs that advocate on these issues. They provide the questions for FOI requests and will later analyze and use the data collected for their advocacy work. We have cooperation with two law-schools’ legal training clinics on FOIA that will file and follow up on hundreds of FOI requests on our issues. We also have several law firms committed to take our FOIA cases to court in cases of undue refusals to give the information.,"Public discussion of issues will be focused on the different aspects of a problem, different solutions offered (instead of just one) and the merits of each. The data collected would facilitate collective impact since it would serve both government officials and NGOs to present, discuss and engage in dialogue over comprehensive solutions.","Einat Hurvitz, is a civil rights lawyer with 15 years of experience in litigation for public causes, building coalitions of NGOs and creating unusual partnerships for social change, including civil society, government or municipalities officials.

Furthermore, they don’t have easy access to information about specific development projects within their communities.

Since then, people around the world from Gezi Park demonstrators in Turkey to Black Lives Matter activists in Ferguson have taken photographs of the tear gas being used on them and shared those photos on social media. In so doing, they hope to hold accountable the companies making the tear gas used on them and purchased with their tax dollars. Occasionally, marginalized communities make organic connections to each other, as we saw when activists in the West Bank tweeted advice on how to recover from a tear gas attack to demonstrators in Ferguson.<br><br>Although tear gas is <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/100-years-of-tear-gas/378632/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">prohibited during warfare</a>, it is still permitted for countries to use domestically. Widely touted as a “non-lethal” technology, there are numerous documented deaths connected to the use of tear gas in the United States and internationally. Tracking and monitoring poses a particular challenge for journalists and rights organizations that riotID hopes to solve through a combination of technology built for crowdsourcing data and fostering a community of citizen journalists engaged in this problem.<br><strong><br>1. Getting the data</strong><br><br>Tracking tear gas is a massive data problem for communities, journalists, and human rights organizations. The main reason? The data does not exist in a structured format or is completely inaccessible. Police departments in the US may require that reports be filed whenever tear gas or other chemical agents are authorized for use. However, these reports – <a href=""https://www.muckrock.com/foi/ferguson-8837/use-of-force-forms-authorizing-the-use-of-chemical-agents-by-ferguson-pd-21378/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">as in the case of the Ferguson Police Department</a> – are considered closed records.<br><br>Crowdsourcing from social media is a great step towards generating this data from the bottom up. People around the world have already organically developed the behavior of tweeting out images of these cannisters when used in their neighborhoods. However, there are a number of challenges posed by crowdsourcing:</p>",,"There are three parts to the problem<br>1) Crowdsourcing from social media is a powerful tool for journalists but carries the risk of inaccurate data <br>2) Community members documenting tear gas on their streets lack a way of ensuring that journalists see their photographs <br>3) There is no unified, searchable database where all information collected on tear gas incidents is collected; there is a wealth of data that is being left on the table waiting to be capture in a meaningful, structured format",We have mockups for the complete user interfaces of the smartphone app and the web app verification system.

By analysing for the first time trade and fish catch data, together with satellite, land antennae signalling and vessel-based geo-location data only now available through our partner FishSpektrum’s Krakken database – the largest in the world with over 1,800,000 fishing vessel references–, we aim to shed light on this issue and fill the information gap.","ODI, FishSpektrum, PorCausa and CartoDB partnered to produce a report to be released this year revealing strong evidence that foreign fishing fleets had failed to report thousands of tonnes of fish caught in Western African waters in 2013. Crucially, we showed that the industry has also devised ways to transport the fish out of Western Africa by using mainly containers which, in effect, bypasses existing anti-IUU legislation.","The new project will be grounded on these findings and will utilise a proven methodology, while its scope will be scaled up along three dimensions: <br>•	In geographic ambition, covering the whole African continent; <br>•	In number of vessels examined, from just reefer vessels to include all fishing vessels, from all foreign fleets, active in the region in 2013 and 2014;<br>•	In the activities analysed, from looking at how fish is transported to  include captures and transhipments.",MIREN GUTIERREZ  -  Research Associate (ODI).<br>ALFONSO DANIELS - Investigative journalist and media consultant (ODI).<br>GONZALO FANJUL - Researcher focused on poverty and inequality (porCausa). <br>ARANTXA GUEREÑA - Agricultural engineer and researcher (porCausa).<br>LUIS AMBROSIO BLÁZQUEZ M.Sc. – Fisheries expert (FishSpektrum).<br>ROBERTO MIELGO BREGAZZI - Fisheries expert (FishSpektrum).<br>DANIEL ROLLERI M.Sc. – Consultat (FishSpektrum).,The project will cover the whole of Africa.

                </p>",Big Social Data in A Box (BSDBox): The Easy-to-Use Social Media Analysis Tool,"Enabling journalists, policymakers and advocates with limited technical skills to harness the power of Data to empower their communities.","<p>Social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, have enabled individuals across the world to produce a tremendous amount of content, while also creating new spaces for social, economic, political and civic engagement. Community leaders, activists and advocates can now use these new channels to reach new audiences, disseminate information and organize collective action.  Data produced on social media also provide an unprecedented opportunity for developing a better understanding of the context of social discussions and the interests of community members. While computer scientists, researchers and corporations are currently making great use of this data, the scale of the data and the skills required to deal with the analysis serve as a barrier to entry for most journalists and community advocates. Big Social Data in a Box (BSDBox) makes social media data work for the individuals and communities, using a next generation cloud-based platform equipped with plug-ins for easy social media analysis/visualization. BSDBox is a comprehensive social data analytic platform designed by data scientists for the people; BSDBox allows a local journalist in Cleveland to tell a story about a community’s online discussion about a housing development project in their neighborhood; BSDBox provides the tools to a homeless rights advocate to collect and present data on social media users’ thoughts and beliefs about homelessness in their city; It is designed for a city council member to gage public interest in her proposed legislation. With an easily accessible backend, users can search existing datasets or allow the platform to mine social media using specific parameters. The platform will provide curated options for visualizing, analyzing and presenting the data in reports, articles, blog posts, and petitions.  In other words, it helps users easily tell data-rich and evidence-based stories about conversations and campaigns happening on social media. These datasets will also be archived on the platform, allowing for the  verifiability of reports and reuse by other members. </p>","This project aims to build an easy-to-use platform and dashboard for anyone (regardless of technical know-how) to methodically collect ‘big data’ sets from various social media platforms, analyze it effectively, and use the data to tell engaging stories for public advocacy and community building.","In physical spaces activists and citizen-journalists can use simple media production tools such as digital cameras and smartphones to capture sensitive moments of intensive social activity, but there is no easy way to capture those moments in social cyberspace. BSDBox is a big data solution to address this need. It will work both as a smartphone for a citizen journalists and activists and a Swiss knife for data analytics in the social cyberspace.","During the past three years we have experimented with different technological solutions to address this need. At this point, we have a very clear idea how will implement this project. Our team members also have the experience teaching courses on big social data analysis for journalists, activists and advocates. This experience will be translated to a MOOC to empower groups around the world to be able to make data work for them and their communities.","Success will first be measured by the power and usability of the cloud-based dashboard for data collection, analysis and visualization; the creation of a data repository for the long-term preservation of data sets used for creating reports; and a MOOC on Big Social Data analysis targeted to non-technical audiences. However, our success is not only measured in the technical operability of the platform but also our team’s ability to engage with different communities and educational institutions.","Emad Khazraee, PhD: Sociotechnical Information Scientist, Big Data<br>Stefania Milan, PhD: Director of the Data J Lab (<a href=""http://datajlab.nl"" target=""_blank"">http://datajlab.nl</a>/), Big Data &amp; Data Activism<br>Anatoliy Gruzd, PhD: Director of <a href=""http://socialmedialab.ca"" target=""_blank"">http://socialmedialab.ca</a>, Big Data and Network Science<br>Laura Schwartz-Henderson: Community engagement &amp; Information Policy advocacy<br>Susan Zake: Data Journalism<br>Jan Leach: Data Journalism<br>Karen Gracy, PhD: Digital Preservation and Data Curation<br>Marcia Zeng, PhD: Linked Data and Data Curation","Akron and Kent, Ohio; Kent State University, College of Communication and Information"

Communities, governments, companies and institutions at all levels are now making data more open and available than ever before, and this tool empowers anyone who has a desire to investigate data to create and share fact-driven stories. The potential of the tool grows as more people use it. Since the tool is open source and extensible, additional features can be added by other users. Each data visualization in Lenses preserves the steps taken to create it, enabling new users to learn how to make sophisticated graphs by looking at how more advanced users have produced their own visualizations.</p>","We think using data to tell stories should be as simple as drag and drop, so we are developing a visual programming platform that allows users to incorporate any data set, build and publish visualizations, and share them simply.","We believe the tools to produce effective data visualizations should be free, and that the platform should evolve as users contribute to it. The platform of the future should be flexible, extensible and portable for other purposes. Many of the projects Knight will fund in this Challenge could in fact use Lenses as a primary platform.","This project started as a working group established by NYC Media Lab with Columbia Journalism School, NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering, and developers at News Corp, who together developed a rough prototype. The team secured a Knight Prototype Fund grant to advance the project this fall, and a set of activities are planned through to 2016 to do just that. Other interested parties have emerged, such as the Associated Press, and we continue to see creative developments on the platform.","So far Lenses supports several kinds of analysis and a number of stories and applications have been crafted using the platform. A major outcome we seek in the near term is to build out the “story finding” capabilities of the platform, with the goal of creating a complete pipeline from data points in the world to stories shared. Additionally, we seek to drive adoption of the platform through introductory classes and workshops on data literacy and how to use the platform to learn data science.","The Lenses team is an effort spanning four NYC-based institutions: News Corp, New York University, Columbia University, and NYC Media Lab.

A lot of these laws contradict the Russian Constitution. The Duma is comprised of 450 Deputies, and a closer look reveals some interesting data. Some Deputies will automatically vote for anything pre-approved by their respective faction, and refrain from excersising their own legislative initiative. (Such Deputies usually don’t even attend sessions, having their votes cast by proxy by their colleagues.) Others have been busy setting world records for the number of bills initiated — even though few ever make it into actual laws. Sometimes the only goal of such bills is to test the public’s reaction. Lastly, there are those who’ve been silently opposing the Duma’s dubious process. The project “RubberStamp” offers to track the activities of Duma Deputies using open source data, and to create detailed dossiers on individual members of the Duma and factions. It would also allow to look for anomalies in the decision-making process, to identify hidden influence groups within the Duma, and to predict which future laws will get passed.</p>","Russia’s Parliament has gone on an endless law-issuing spree, passing numerous pieces of legislation that range from repressive to downright unconstitutional. We will show exactly who drafts these laws and who votes for them.","Journalists, researchers, and citizens in Russia have limited understanding of how the Russian Duma works. Roughly a dozen of the 450 Deputies maintain a high profile in the media, but it’s still hard to assess their real input. Even less is known about the law-makers who keep a low profile. Before Russia’s next election in 2016, it would be invaluable to learn the roles of the current Deputies, and to have a tool to analyze the activities of Deputies to come.","The project is currently at the preparation stage.

In the eyes of many neighborhoods, the justice system now faces a crisis of legitimacy, with residents of these marginalized communities demanding greater input into the policies that governments at all levels are deploying to build healthy neighborhoods and more effective justice systems. At the Urban Institute, we have pioneered several strategies for helping communities build better policy and we want to build on this by developing a mobile app to bridge this gap and to provide communities with a way to provide data directly to government so that their voices create better, more responsive policy.</p>",We want to develop and launch a new mobile platform that allows communities to provide real-time feedback to their governments.,"Government policy needs the buy-in of communities to be effective. However, it is often exceedingly difficult to access the voices of marginalized communities who do not have the time or resources to travel to public meetings or respond to opinion surveys. Door-to-door surveys can access their views but these efforts are costly, difficult to sustain, and often cannot be completed in time to inform rapidly moving discussions. Communities need a more efficient way to make themselves heard.","We have used community-based surveys to assess violence prevention and prisoner reentry efforts in Chicago neighborhoods, demonstrating that soliciting opinions directly from community members provides essential insights for crafting government policy that is effective and legitimate in the eyes of the communities it is intended to serve. We have also conducting door-to-door surveys that demonstrate that there are enough mobile phones and in these neighborhoods to make this project viable.","Success in this project would be a viable mobile phone survey system that has been successfully pushed out to a representative array of residents in under-served Washington, DC neighborhoods. A viable system will have a high level of resident response to survey questions and will be effective in soliciting insights that government leaders can use to better craft policies that reflect the perspective of the community.","Jocelyn Fontaine, Dan Lawrence, and Jesse Jannetta are senior Urban Institute researchers with substantial experience leading surveys of marginalized communities. Jocelyn is also the evaluation director of the National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice.  Nancy La Vigne is the director of Urban Institute’s Justice Policy Center and co-leader on the National Initiative. Tim Meko is Urban Institute’s design manager and has been recognized for excellence in web design.","We plan to use Washington, DC, the site of the Urban Institute, as the site for this pilot project.  Urban has significant experience working with the DC communities we want to launch this platform in and we will leverage this experience to maximize this project’s chances for success. We also have experience working with the DC government that will allow us to get data from this pilot into the hands of policymakers who can put it to good use."

While the audience for newspapers remains strong in the state, Iowa journalists are adapting to the changing environment for digital news – including the shift to data-driven narratives. Interviews with journalists around the state have evidenced that newspaper reporters – particularly those who work for rural, weekly publications – seek the skills, tools and expertise to effectively integrate data into day-to-day newsroom routines. More specifically, Iowa journalists need to understand how to code, how to locate open data, how to analyze datasets and how to visualize that information for an audience.

Ideally, audience members should actively participate in the formation of data narratives.</p>","In partnership with the Iowa Newspaper Foundation, the Iowa Data Journalism Training Institute (headquartered at Iowa State University’s Greenlee School of Journalism and Communication) would provide hands-on and web-based training in coding, data analysis and visualization to nearly 300 daily and weekly newspapers in Iowa.",Nearly nine in 10 (88%) newspapers in Iowa publish weekly.

Whether it is a small organization, a local advocacy group, an established human rights group or a multinational development organization, almost all social change initiatives we engage with are adopting new tools and data-driven strategies with great enthusiasm. However, because these challenges are amorphous and complex, it can be next to impossible for an organization to determine how best to use digital tools responsibly without specialist guidance and learnings from across relevant sectors.</p>","We want to grow our community of responsible data problem solvers into a community of practice; to solve complex responsible data problems and streamline the process for others approaching these challenges; and facilitate communities to build resources that are functional, efficient and reach the growing group of interested organisations and initiatives.","Let’s say you are an advocacy organization that has been collecting data in paper form from your community for years.

With most free platforms and services you, the user, are the product and not the customer, but this is not something that people are generally aware of.  The way in which people participate with their data would never be acceptable if this testing was solicited in the high street or in the forecourt of a shopping centre where informed consent, an awareness of remuneration, and some idea of the purpose of the data collection is made clear at the outset of participation. It certainly would not happen in academic research where any project would be scrutinized by an ethics committee. This problem is about more than reading the fine print of the bank statement or the loan agreement. People need to be aware that they are giving away the information that constitutes their electronic record of their lives – public, professional, and personal – where it can be used for who knows what purposes, positive, negative, and who profits. This obfuscated feedback loop of cause and effect: or lack of transparency leads to lack of trust, and ultimately a withdrawal from civic engagement.</p>","This applied learning platform progressively reveals who’s behind the data curtain as the user navigates the content, informing users about what can be harvested from them, what that information can be used to infer, and unforeseen consequences may arise.","We plan to develop a tool that enables agency for individuals in learning environments.

My daughters, whose recent migration to NYC drew me here, are in careers that reflect this fascination--one a lawyer and data privacy expert, the other a scenic artist. In my spare time I work with organizations like Personal Data Ecosystem Consortium (on the governance committee), Project VRM, and mentor young entrepreneurs seeking to launch data-driven startups that exemplify ethical practices in uses of big data and algorithms.

We provide tools to aggregate data from private sources and across the web. The Lumenous system uniquely applies interactive machine learning to manage user-aggregated data of uncertain structure and provenance. This approach makes it possible to deliver instant visualization, unprecedented sharing flexibility, and data fidelity assessment. Business owners gain the controls they want and creditors the verification they need.</p>","Lumenous helps businesses harness and share real-time data with lenders and other creditors on their terms, standing in contrast to the black box systems of credit bureaus and big data underwriting.","Today, some 20M small businesses face opaque, unregulated, and impersonal data practices to access credit and economic opportunity. In addition to the pain of making a good case “in the dark,” they often don’t get the money and terms they deserve. This keeps them from adding jobs and contributing to the economic health of their communities. As many more U.S. workers turn free agent this segment will grow exponentially and increasingly be left out of participating in economic opportunity.","Lumenous has working code developed and tested with small business partners of Intel and Applied Materials as well as credit officers and analysts in small business lending and procurement. Creditors not only contributed to our system and methods but also brought clients to pilots, Several major networks of small businesses, including Intel channel management and CenterState Banks’ correspondent division (1K community banks), have signed commitments to go to market with Lumenous.","With Knight funding, we will conduct pilots in communities with high numbers of minority and women-owned small businesses.

Our downtown is the most unique urban laboratory allowing for a rich study of social, human, and economic interaction that drives our understanding of how we use place. The Miami DDA has been working with CyberCity and Cesium to develop an intelligent platform that leverages new geospatial technology which incorporates 3D visuals with unique data on how Downtown Miami functions. This project will expand our current platform and allow us to build a truly futuristic analytic tool that will uncover the dynamism of our urban systems. A revised platform will be developed so that other cities can easily and affordably make use of the infrastructure we build.</p>",This project will finalize a 3D data and visualization platform for Downtown Miami and will act as the foundation by which other cities can showcase their downtowns and explore the impacts tomorrow of decisions made today.,"Downtown Miami has emerged as a truly unique destination to live, work, and play.

Since the 1970s, wages have flatlined and social goods like education have been gutted and privatized. Easy access to credit has helped to create the illusion that prosperity has been broadly shared. In truth, most people have been forced into debt as they struggle to finance basic needs like education, housing, and health care. Today, almost 75% of Americans are in some kind of debt, and one out of seven of us is being hounded by a debt collector. At the same time, creditors hold most of the information about our loans. Many people are not sure who they owe or who ultimately profits from their payments.

Access to personal financial data should be a right. Through organizing with students who attended now bankrupt Corinthian Colleges, we have seen how information can reduce the shame of debt, help make complex systems comprehensible and inspire action. We believe that access to data is a step towards shifting the balance of power between creditors and debtors.","In 2014, we launched the nation’s first-ever student debt strike with students defrauded by the for-profit Corinthian Colleges chain.

The sensor in the wearable device can measure temperature very precisely, day and night and is able to transfer this data to a registered mobile phone located in the vicinity of the person. The wearable device sends data to the phone through a dedicated application which includes a special phone message (SMS, ringing sound, or vibration) indicating that according to the readings of all real time data, and controlled through historical records the chance of conceiving is high. By accurately tracking one of the two essential fertility signs in women (temperature) and allowing to easily record the other fertility sign (cervical fluid), an effective, low cost, high impact solution becomes available to the roughly 220 million women in developing nations who want to plan and space their pregnancies. </p>","With our mobile apps and smart wearable devices, we help women effortlessly track their menstrual cycles to improve their reproductive health, prevent pregnancies naturally and achieve pregnancies easily.","To achieve gender equality it is essential to provide women with family planning tools that are effective and safe. The Fertility Awareness Method (FAM) is a scientifically validated method of natural birth control that involves charting fertility signs (temperature and cervical fluid) to identify if a woman is fertile on a specific day. If all rules are followed, its effectiveness rate is about 95-97 percent over the course of a year. Its main advantage is no health risks or side effects.","Currently we have a mobile application design prototype intended to track menstrual cycles and general health symptoms. We have started doing user testing, and the next step is to code the prototype for iOS and Android devices.","Our first successful outcome would be to launch the mobile application in English and Spanish for iOS and Android devices, and our ultimate successful outcome would be to launch a low cost wearable device in the US and Latin America.","Carolina Pachon: web development, digital marketing, UI/UX design<br>Karina Ketter: operations management, project management and financial control","San Jose, CA &amp; Denver, CO"

Solutions journalism is a complement to traditional watchdog reporting – rather than looking at data just for evidence of wrongdoing or error, solutions journalism pushes us to look at the data for evidence of what’s worked, and to explore how we as a community might scale or replicate those successes.</p>","By teaching and encouraging journalists to explore open data for evidence of what’s working, rather than just what’s wrong, we will get additional,  actionable solutions journalism out to the world, and reduce possible trepidation city officials feel when releasing new data sets.","Solutions journalism is still a novel or sometimes unfamiliar concept to many journalists. The major limiting factor in consistent and repeatable production of solutions journalism by local and metro newsrooms is familiarity with data journalism tools and techniques, required to identify the solutions that may be present and findable within open data.","Applicants have brainstormed with colleagues representing the City of Philadelphia Office of Information and Technology, Hacks/Hackers, Open Data Philly, and Code for Philly. And networked with leaders from the civic hacking, education, and legal communities. We have located spaces where we can convene. We have validated the idea with community newsrooms to check interest in solutions journalism/data journalism. We are deeply rooted in regional journalism and journalism education communities.","These workshops will seek to: 1) teach practical data journalism skills that allow journalists to interrogate public data from their desktops; 2) expand on connections between solutions journalism and data journalism; 3) explain solutions journalism and its relation to journalism writ large; 4) charge journalists with trying a solutions journalism approach in future work, for the virtuous cycle it creates by promoting civic successes and making bureaucrats comfortable with future data releases.","Jim MacMillan manages the Center for Public Interest Journalism at Temple University’s School of Media and Communication, where he also maintains Open Data Philly, a regional open data catalog which also serves at the official repository for the City of Philadelphia.<br><br>Davis Shaver is technical manager of new digital products at the Philadelphia Media Network (Inquirer, Daily News, &amp; <a href=""http://Philly.com"" target=""_blank"">http://Philly.com</a>).

The HMIS just like the Constitution prescribes a framework for accessing its information. Without adequate community sensitisation and institutional capacity to  operationalize the various access to information provisions, the data in the HMIS remains useless to the public. The project will make health information available and accessible to the public.","CEHURD has established Community Health Advocates (CHAs) in Buikwe District, Kamwenge District and Kiboga District who are community individuals acting as a link between communities and health leaders. CEHURD has also comprehensively engaged Health Unit Management Committees in the same districts on the right to health and access to health services. These structures will be used in addition to our strong relationship with the Ministry of Health to realise the objectives of the project.","A successful outcome of this project will be reduced barriers to accessing public health information among grassroot communities in Uganda. By working with the Ministry of Health to proactively disclose public health information collected by the HMIS and by empowering the public to seek and obtain information under the HMIS, the project will reduce barriers to accessing public health information among grassroot communities and thereby improve health and well-being.","Mulumba Moses is the Executive Director of CEHURD and has successfully been a principle and co-investigator on a number of research projects and is a PhD candidate.

I've worked in child welfare, early childhood, education/higher ed for 25+ years. One thing that continues to amaze me is how difficult it can be to find data and how little citizens and policy-makers use data in decision-making. When data is available, it is often dispersed over several unrelated websites and/or a written request must be made to access it.
I want to change this. As the former Director of the National Data Analysis System, I know it is possible to build a user-friendly database that is accessible and functional. The other piece of this puzzle is understanding the data. Over the years, I have responded to hundreds of calls, tweets, e-mails, and in-person inquiries from journalists, practitioners, policy-makers, and the general public about child welfare data. Obviously I don't have all the answers. And it would be so much easier if people could go to a website, access all types of data, and have access to millions of other people worldwide who can clarify and explain data and it's implications. There have been many times when I've spent hours, even days, trying to track down a piece of information or data. Given the technology available, there is no reason all data related to children and youth could not be available at one location. Even better, people should be able to interact directly with one another, getting answers to pressing questions without having to make dozens of calls or inquiries trying to find people who have the information needed. If everyone had access to data and information about children and youth, they would be better informed about their communities and could use this information to make intelligent decisions about legislation, policies, philanthropy, and other critical issues in their communities.

This web-based repository will be a place where people can ask questions and engage in dialogue with governmental officials, experts, and professionals in a variety of fields to gain a full understanding of data, what it means, and how it can be used to improve communities.</p>","Data regarding children and families will be collected from several governmental agencies, communities, and organizations and shared in a wiki-format to allow users to ask questions, seek clarification, and engage in meaningful dialogue that will lead to stronger communities and a well-informed public.","Data regarding children and youth is often difficult to find and when it is available, it can be misleading with limited (or slanted) explanation or clarification. The Community Data Wiki will promote dialogue and give the public access to a variety of experts to better understand data and its' implications for individuals, families, and communities.","Data spanning several years has been collected in several areas, including child well-being, juvenile justice, child abuse, teen pregnancy, and poverty rates. The concept has been discussed with leaders in a number of fields and preliminary plans have been outlined for the structure of a website providing access to data and allowing for the exchange of information and ideas via a wiki format.","Everyone would have access to data about the children and families in their communities and have the opportunity to engage in meaningful dialogue in order to address critical societal challenges such as child abuse and juvenile crime. Decisions made at the local, state, and national levels would be well-informed and responsive to community needs.",Connie Hayek is the former director of the National Data Analysis System and is dedicated to bringing about greater access to and understanding of data about children and families.

With Trackography we want to open a broader discussion about 3rd party tracking and ensure users make informed choices.",Earlier this year we developed a successful beta version of Trackography to have a proof of concept on how to track trackers. We looked into third party trackers  included in news websites in 38 countries.

The beta version served to test interest for the further development. We also received a lot of interest numerous &amp; requests to further develop the beta version.,"A user friendly, accessible platform that serves two key audiences; general users – individuals and communities, as well as journalists, researchers and NGOs. The first outcome is a broader awareness among users on third party tracking of the sites they visit, paired with information and advice on how they can mitigate this. The second outcome will lead to  journalists  being able to back up their research with comprehensive data sets by sub category on which sites are being tracked.","A Tactical Tech team of developers with each up to 12 years of experience will develop and test the platform.

Consequently, Indonesian government currently make efforts to reduce Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) as one of the priorities. The main causes of the high maternal mortality rate is 1) delays in the provision of services to high risk pregnant women having delivery, 2) the lack of information regarding the handling of high risk pregnancies, and 3) unavailability of identification in regard to high-risk pregnancies in communities, particularly marginalized communities.</p>","We will use SMS to connect high-risk pregnant women and hospital that can provide them health services, from monitoring their pregnancy condition until giving birth.","We are trying to address 2 needs: (1) connection between pregnant women and reproductive health services, (2) availability of adequate information. Currently, the connection is very weak and almost none, due to unavailability of convenient channel for pregnant mothers and community to report their condition to hospital. Considering vulnerable condition of high-risk pregnant women, there should be an easy channel to support their communication to hospital.","This proposed concept has been piloted in one district in Indonesia, registering more than 200 high-risk pregnant women. User of this system includes rural health volunteers, local government, and hospital personnel. This SMS gateway will be developed to use open data from hospitals, thus pregnant women can understand availability of health service facilities (bed, doctor, etc.) at certain hospital. It will help them to decide where to send a high-risk pregnant woman for maternal health care.","By using our SMS gateway, we expect three outcomes to happen: 1) Pregnant women (particularly having high risk pregnancies) or her family and community can easily make early report of their pregnancies to the hospital; 2) Hospital is equipped with the ability in identifying mothers with high risk pregnancies; and 3) Hospitals are equipped in making early preparation in delivery service provision for high risk pregnant mothers, allowing them to have assurance of adequate care when giving birth.","Siti Fatimah, specialization in climate change issue, governance work, community development<br>Markus Christian, senior researcher on community resilience and governance work<br>Widi Heriyanto, volunteer networking specialist, capacity building specialist, trainer of curriculum development &amp; manager on capacity building on human rights, environment issues<br>Santi, competent in gender studies, research <br>Darso, Information Technology specialist on designing the system and application","Pekalongan Regency, Central Java, Indonesia"

Practically every facet of our lives is now touched by a decision driven by data science. But as scale and complexity grows, several questions loom large: How can we uncover truths hidden deep in the data? How can we effectively communicate such massive and complicated data to its intended audience? And how can we illuminate, clarify, and spark insights for the general public? Data journalism, evidenced by new mainstays like 538 and the Upshot, is making extensive and practical progress on the challenges of clear and compelling narrative data visualization and communication. However, while effective, a well-crafted data story requires considerable time, expertise, and resources to create. For this reason, there is currently a much larger demand for such data stories than there are data journalists capable of constructing them.</p>","Under the supervision of expert data journalists, student communicators will work with data science producers, or “clients”, to translate that data science into accessible and engaging data stories in the public interest that will be published online.","The deluge of data science happening throughout industry, academia, and government is often poorly communicated in reports or papers that are difficult to parse and understand.

They face powerful opposition due to the high financial gains from environmental destruction. Their struggles are mainly reported only after a murder or attack. Without recognition while they are alive—often physically isolated—they are vulnerable. They often do not have information on what support is available, even from specialist HR and environmental groups; or knowledge of their rights. Impunity is high, due to international silence.","We have built collaborations with Global Witness and Frontline Defenders to reach environmental defenders who would benefit from international exposure and who want to build international campaigns. We are collaborating with Frontline Defenders to start mapping the organizations and resources available to support environmental defenders, which we will develop into a web page with emergency contact details.

We're currently featuring 10 survivor stories, which have been read by 5000+ unique visitors. Preliminary qualitative data shows the process of writing and posting one's story helps decrease feelings of shame and isolation around sexual victimization.","Our main outcome is for survivors of sexual violence to heal. Research shows that the process of writing about trauma (specifically, writing about what occurred and one's thoughts and feelings about what occurred) allows individual to 1) put language to experience (making sense of it) and 2) reframe experience, which can lead to decreased self-blame/internalization -- both vital steps in the healing process.

Rather, we are focused on the social networks and on-line tools that make it easy to produce a survey without understanding the underlying assumptions that are made and ramifications of those assumptions. Of particular concern is the proper capture and weighting of demographic and socioeconomic factors in collecting social data. Journalists, interest groups, public policy officials use these tools to generate quick assessments on what the crowd is thinking.  Unfortunately, most people simply don’t have the knowledge or expertise to understand and correct for sampling bias when they generate a survey or questionnaire.  Questions such as, “What set of people am I trying to represent with this information?” or “Which demographic questions should I ask?” or “How do I properly adjust my data for survey sample bias?” go unconsidered or are too difficult to tackle. As a result, both intuitive conclusions and more formal analytic results from that data are at the very least flawed, typically flat-out wrong, and always indefensible.</p>","Our project will give the public online tools to create surveys that are more scientifically sound – allowing everyone the ability to poll the crowd and share reliable, credible results.","We all shape our beliefs and decisions with studies, speeches, and articles that often rely on informal survey data. Social networks and tools make it easy to create surveys without considering critical subtleties (such as weighting demographic factors). Without correcting for these, conclusions from this data are unreliable at best.

However, it is estimated there are 300,000 abortions annually in Peru. Therefore, and because of the criminalization, these are underground abortions done in a context of vulnerability. Women are exposed to gangs of people profiting from them; women do not receive adequate information anywhere, and in most cases women risk their lives. So, when women arrive at health centers with incomplete abortions, it doesn’t matter if it was a spontaneous abortion or a self-induced abortion, health care providers presume they had an auto-induced abortion and mistreat them by judging them, by making terrible comments or –even worse- by calling the police or the prosecutor. The stigma surrounding women who abort is always the same: a young, irresponsible one, one without a partner. Women tend to depend on the health care providers’ subjectivity (nurses’ empathy, medical staff kindness and midwives) to deal with the emergency without criminalizing them. The Colectiva por la Libre Información para las Mujeres has been managing a medical abortion hotline for the last 5 years, and we have been dealing with incomplete abortions questions for the last 2 years. Since then we identified the need to organize proper information for women dealing with incomplete abortions. The aim of this project is the collective building of an online, free-access, map that visibilizes the women’s stories about the violence they have experienced in Peruvian health centers and organize online activities to visibilize that information. In the Peruvian context, where in spite abortion is criminalized there is a growing political debate regarding abortion, this initiative is crucial. </p>","Visibilize the women’s violence stories experienced in public health centers through the collective building of an online, free-access, map hosted in our website <a href=""http://abortoinfosegura.com/blog/"" target=""_blank"">http://abortoinfosegura.com/blog/</a>.","Women experiencing an incomplete abortion should have access to information about the procedures they should follow in order to diminish their criminalization and mistreat in public health centers. The lack of public information, easily accessible, based on women’s stories regarding their incomplete abortion and the violence they experience in public health centers is a reality and we intend to disseminate that information as vastly as possible.","The Colectiva por la Libre Información para las Mujeres is a feminist organization formed in 2009, and 5 years ago we launched the abortion hotline 945-411-951 giving information about abortion with pills, with no cost for the women. More than 8 thousand women have received information. We have just started the initial phase of a self-managed research on incomplete abortion and women’s rights.","It is important to note that we will keep the women’s anonymity and personal information, for their security. We would consider this project successful if we accomplish:<br>•	An online, free-access, collectively-built map<br>•	Visual material: flyers and infographics<br>•	Trimonthly reports (with qualitative and quantitative data)<br>•	Open-data (excluding women’s personal information) to engage collaboration with other organizations for further and –ideally, collective- analysis.","We are an interdisciplinary and feminist team:<br>Fátima Valdivia del Rio: Anthropologist and Project manager<br>Andrea Gómez Urrutia: Anthropologist and ICT specialist<br>Arón Núnes-Curto: Anthropologist and researcher<br>Cynthia Núnes-Curto: Communications officer <br>GDA (name will is not public, for security reasons): External technical advisor","We are based in Lima (Peru); initially, the project will gather information from women living in Lima.

New America’s Resilient Communities Program (RCP) is currently working with a range of community partners in six New York City neighborhoods impacted by Hurricane Sandy. Our efforts will create communications networks owned and operated by local residents and small businesses and we are seeking opportunities to align and leverage additional resilience benefits as we conduct this work. Our proposal is to install pedestrian count sensors directly into the wireless communications routers and nodes to generate real time information about foot traffic in these communities. The sensors track any mobile phone or device with a media access control (MAC) address, an unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications (typically for Ethernet or wi-fi). We plan to issue an open invitation for applications and solutions for how this data might be used based on problems and needs identified by residents, civic organizations, local activists, and small businesses. </p>","As New America's Resilient Communities Program supports the creation of community wireless networks in six Sandy impacted neighborhoods in New York City, we will partner with local community groups to decide how real time pedestrian count sensors can be used to solve problems and address the needs and priorities of local communities.","Today there are significant hurdles to keeping track of pedestrian activity. A human clicking a thumb counter is time-consuming and inaccurate. While video cameras and other smart tech may be more reliable, equipment can be expensive and its functionality is limited. By putting decisions about these technologies, their uses and privacy protections directly into the hands of communities they are intended to serve, empowers locals, strengthens existing social networks and improves quality of life.","We are a winner of the RISE competition from NYC’s Economic Development Corporation. Our grant will enable us to work with a coalition of local partners to design, build, and program local broadband network infrastructure; it will also fund training for a local workforce of ""Digital Stewards"" to develop and maintain wireless networks including local servers, hosting, and apps. We have already identified a menu of hardware and firmware that can include embedded sensors to track pedestrian flow,","Communities – local groups, activists, business improvement districts, small businesses and residents – would have real time information about when their streets are being used. They will also have solutions from a cross section of innovators about how that information can be utilized to strengthen their communities.

There is no resource today that outlines the legal implications of hackathons, most likely because there is an attitude of good will at hackathons and paying lawyers to review sparse legal precedent, is expensive.  These explanations however do not make the potential for intellectual property and copyright infringement any less precarious and the need for open source re-useable participation agreements any less urgent. </p>","Think you don’t need to agree on terms at hackathons?

This leaves important questions, with intellectual property and copyright considerations undocumented and unanswered.","To date, we have drafted a memorandum outlining the legal implications for participants and organizers of hackathons, which has been reviewed by Law Professor Susan Jones at the George Washington University.

Turning them into useful data that can be linked and enriched with additional information requires extensive interpretation. There are dedicated communities from Digital Humanities scholars to genealogists willing to invest time and effort, but the tools have largely been restricted to individual projects and well-funded bodies. Maintaining access to datasets outside of project duration has also proved problematic.",OHM started in April 2013 with the creation of server infrastructure based on that of OSM. Data has been added across the world reflecting a wide range of historical periods and thematic topics. iD editor for OHM is included in the Wikimaps Warper in Wikimedia Labs. An OHM specific version of the iD editor has been developed. Use of OHM data has been demonstrated with linked data; for historical routing and theme-specific websites.,"We aim to secure a robust workflow for entering, visualizing and accessing data into OHM. To address the input and display of time we by provide direct support in the online iD editor, develop an alternative rendering approach, and extend Overpass for temporal queries. We expect to find elegant ways to deal with data: source referencing, structured and linked metadata and clever modelling of space over time. Additionally we aim to establish an organizational structure for OHM.","OHM is a heterogenous group, the listed individuals are willing to work to establish the future working environment:<br>Jerry Clough - active OHM/OSM contributor, DB professional with 25 years experience, UK<br>Tim Waters - experienced developer of open source geospatial applications, UK<br>Albin Larsson - developer bridging OHM, Wikimedia, linked data and Nordic cultural heritage, Sweden<br>Susanna Ånäs - project manager for Wikimaps, working with GLAMs, hackathons and geotools, Finland",OHM is working with project across the globe.

The project pipeline originates in the Concepto Foundation's platform. Its strategy to ""fix the system"", invites the participation of citizens of any country in the western hemisphere to present ideas in English or Spanish to solve problems in their communities. These ""organic social innovators"" can present their ideas in any of 25 different categories such as holes in the streets, street children, and other maladies of our societies. After their ideas are entered in the platform, they receive a ranking and points based on their appeal to the communities affected by such a problem. When a specific ranking is achieved, the social innovator receives coaching and support to take it before a panel of research experts from Learning and Technology for Peace, Democracy and Human Rights. The team at Learning for peace will enhance the proposed solution by reviewing the information universe and check its originality and creative against similar ideas already being executed around the world. This is a crucial step in the process as it will help all involved in the process to gage how much information is readily available, how current, and where the best opportunities for succes exist.  The project originality reviewer tool will ready the social innovator to defend the solution and offer polished protocol to execute and replicate,   The curriculum developers at Technology &amp; Entrepreneurship for Community Development (TECODE) will continue to assist the social innovator by helping &gt; them create a structured manual to implement their ideas as a project.

Our project works to make this data available in open formats in ways that benefit everyone involved.","In September 2015, we launched Civic Tech USC and released our first report, “Empowering the Public Through Open Data: Findings and Recommendations for City Leaders in Los Angeles County.” Our research for that report revealed that one of the largest, most important gaps in available government data is in the criminal justice system. That finding led us to conduct additional background research and begin devising a plan for addressing the problem.","In addition to releasing a report on criminal justice data in Los Angeles County, we will work with leaders in LA to make the region a national leader in open criminal justice data.

Libraries fundamentally house information and are curated by people knowledgeable about the collection. American libraries, born of the Carnegie era charity, have become a particularly egalitarian style where stores of knowledge, community gatherings, direct education, and resource matching are available to anyone who choses to access it. Upon this foundation, we propose the prototype of the next iteration of public libraries.<br><br> We propose building a Data Library, the first of its kind, in Southeast, DC in collaboration with public, private, and educational partners. The placement permanently on Saint Elizabeth’s campus roots the commitment of each of the partners in creating a more equitable city, leveraging access to one of the most valuable resources of the future: data.<br><br> Developing data as a force for widespread democratic, social, and economic good will take time, but it must start with a commitment to open data, to teaching how and why data is used, and to sharing the tools of the future with the public of today. Technology is but a means to an end, and that end is the systematized information we are collecting, collating, and mining. Some estimates say that 99% of the world’s information was collected and created in the last decade, but far less than 99% of people know how to access it. The Data Library will be a central space for providing access and a force for change to this dynamic.</p>","This modern take on the library will expand awareness and access to open data resources in underserved neighborhoods, host events for residents to interact and exchange knowledge, provide instruction that trains and empowers residents for technology jobs, and bring in investment to incubate innovations.","As big data becomes normative within America’s social and economic life, too many are being left behind and left out. The digital divide is fast becoming a data divide, and public underinvestment in direct education are allowing the creation of a world of those who have and do not have access to knowledge. Educational institutions, government, and the civic-minded business community can make a difference by creating space for increasing digital literacy and democratizing access to information.","Thus far, we have established a concept paper and a partnership, Open Data District, between committed organizations. Simultaneously, we are building capacity by coordinating public sector interests to invest in this concept.","Success looks like a physical location in SE Washington DC that convenes existing groups (such as Code for DC) and serves as a lighthouse for community members interested in advancing their tech skills and investors interested in new ideas. <br><br>Success looks like the launching of courses and trainings that benefit residents and the city.

The hackathon, held in five cities across the country, will offer a unique space in which participants can blend quantitative and qualitative approaches to making large, complex datasets more accessible and meaningful for the general public. In the process, they will foster new creative collaborations and help develop greater data literacy for themselves and their communities. This project builds on the success of the inaugural Datalore Hack held at the MIT Media Lab in January 2015 (see <a href=""http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/01/at-datalore-data-plus-storytelling-means-empathy-humor-and-games/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nieman Lab article</a> or visit the <a href=""http://datalorehack.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Datalore 2015 website</a> for more information). </p>","Datalore Hacks is a series of five weekend-long hackathons held in cities across the U.S. that will bring together interdisciplinary teams and challenge them to translate publicly-available datasets on local city-level issues into creative, engaging narrative experiences.","Despite the increasing availability of data, analyzing and interpreting complex datasets often requires technical expertise and high data literacy. This makes it challenging for most communities to translate data relevant to their lives into accessible, meaningful and actionable stories. Datalore Hacks will help close this gap between the availability of data and the literacy required to make sense of it.","In January 2015, the inaugural Datalore Hack was held at the MIT Media Lab. The event brought together 60 people working on 8 teams and culminated in prototypes that continue to be developed, such as Forest Flip and Storybot. We learned how to curate effective, interdisciplinary teams and create an experience that was intensive, fun and creatively rewarding. We have begun organizing the 2016 Datalore and we have also been approached about holding Datalore Hacks in additional cities.","A successful Datalore Hack will result in two primary outcomes. First, the event will allow teams to develop working prototypes of data-centered narrative projects that are ready to be deployed within local communities, online or in physical locations, or ready to be developed with additional resources. Second, the events will improve data literacy among participants and audiences while fostering creative collaborations, networks and partnerships that endure well beyond the hackathon weekend.","Nadja Oertelt - scientist, producer and filmmaker who likes to bring art into quantitative spaces - Senior Producer in editorial video at Mashable - formerly at HarvardX producing The Fundamentals of Neuroscience<br><br>Sean Flynn - documentary film producer / festival organizer focused on emerging media, immersive storytelling and social impact - former researcher at MIT OpenDocLab<br><br>Heather Craig - recent alum of MIT’s Center for Civic Media, where she focused on data and interactive storytelling","The second Datalore Hack will be held in Cambridge, MA, in January 2016.

Nowadays, most websites use cookies, third-party cookies, scripts, third-party scripts, tracking cookies, tracking scripts etc. Unfortunately, that's not even the worst part. The worst part is that, even if you realize what is happening and are willing to do something about it, trying to get all of that under control is not for the faint of heart. Even for the few who can get accustomed to the hassle of aggressively managing their cookies and scripts using various browser add-ons such as <a target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://noscript.net/"">NoScript</a>, <a rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" href=""https://disconnect.me/"">Disconnect</a> or <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.ghostery.com/en/"" target=""_blank"">Ghostery</a>, learning how to use these tools is a painful process of trial-and-error. On one hand, some things may not work anymore if you disable some third-party scripts, some things may not work anymore if you don't allow various types of cookies. But, on the other hand, are you really sure you want to be continuously tracked by, for example Facebook, through their nearly omni-present Like button? What about those scripts from cloudfront.net that keep popping up in NoScript? Should you or shouldn't you allow them to run? Who are those cloudfront.net people anyway? And what about when you plan a research trip – where you can find the tracker forecast for countries like Russia or Turkey or China? These are a lot of questions that one doesn't ask before taking the red pill of managing one's web scripting usage.</p>","There already are a number of projects that analyze the online tracking systems which can be found on most of web sites nowadays. However, they go about doing this in a rather manual manner. Their methods of data gathering are automated, but just to a certain degree. We are proposing a complete automation of the data gathering process and building a platform that provides access to the raw data, as well as venue for those interested in online tracking, both as end users and as developers.","We are trying to make it easier for the regular web user to know what happens when browsing the Web, and, both directly and indirectly, provide him with necessary the tools to increase his control over his web browsing experience in general and his online privacy in particular. We are also aiming to give data journalists, developers and researchers the means to investigate online tracking, understand it and use that knowledge to create the tools the regular users need.","We have investigated what has been done when it comes to analyzing online tracking systems. We have analyzed the existing tools allowing users to control their web browsing. We have planned how to leverage existing open source projects to speed-up development of our automatic data gathering system. We will get in touch with Share Labs to invite them to collaborate on this project, given that they're familiar with the problem at hand and their data visualization development skills are first rate.","Successfully implementing the integration of script and cookie detection in the YaCy web crawler, deploying the modified web crawler in order to gather data and producing a few examples of data journalistic analyses based on the gathered data.

These reports are geo-coded, mapped and analyzed to find trends such as accident hot spots, peak accident times, and most-affected road users, that can inform policy makers and arm citizens with the knowledge to demand safer roads for all road users.","Traffic accidents are a leading cause of death, and when they don't result in fatalities, they can still cause serious injury, property damage, and traffic jams. Although the Kenyan government has made reducing accidents a public goal, even they admit that there is no clear data to drive these efforts. Crowd-sourcing can solve the lack of data in an inexpensive, scalable way that simultaneously engages the public and raises their awareness of the problem.","Our engagement/data collection began in May and will run through October. Users have submitted on average over 1,000 accident reports per month that translate into data on a monthly average of 500 unique accidents, concentrated in Nairobi but stretching along highways to several other towns and cities. Blog posts and tweets remind users to keep participating and 100 KES ($1) rewards are given weekly to 5 randomly selected contributors.","Data is only as useful as its application. We need to leverage the momentum of the crowd-sourcing effort to put pressure on policy makers (government &amp; NGOs) to make some concrete plans to reduce accidents. We propose to write a comprehensive report on the data and analysis, to collect recommendations from stakeholders such as local NGOs, bus and taxi drivers, and finally, to hold an event where policy makers and stakeholders can come together to discuss the report and recommendations.","Elizabeth Resor has a Master's in City Planning from MIT and two years of experience working in Nairobi with technology start-ups in the transportation sector. She is experienced in data management, analysis and visualization. She also brings experience writing for academic and policy-oriented audiences.

In an age when visual media is as common and useful as verbal, first responders and journalists need to better understand how and why images spread and how information needs differ between ground zero and the global public.

Despite the tremendous cost to taxpayers, ICE is secretive about its detention contracting and inspection processes. ICE only provides information about inspections and what facilities it uses when forced via FOIA requests and litigation. The use of private contractors further obfuscates how billions of taxpayer dollars are spent and human rights protected.","In an August 2015 report NIJC analyzed and released 90 contracts and the deposition testimony of a former ICE contracting officer. In October 2015, NIJC and the Detention Watch Network will release a second report with ICE inspection reports for 100+ facilities. In November 2015, NIJC and the Detention Watch Network will release a toolkit to help communities use the contracts and inspections to advocate to end contracts at facilities that violate immigrants’ human rights.","Success would transform NIJC’s Immigration Detention Transparency and Human Rights Project into a living online space that allows communities to monitor the U.S. government’s management of the immigration detention system and provide a meaningful tool to advocate for reforms. Ultimately, these efforts would make the system more transparent, expose mismanagement and misconduct, and help end the unnecessary incarceration of immigrant men, women, and children.","NIJC is dedicated to ensuring human rights protections and access to justice for immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers.

We truly believe that information technology can contribute to a more open, more transparent and more democratic way of governing.

It provides an interactive tool that allows the monitoring of procurement processes and their implementation by citizens, journalists or even public officials and catch fraud risks at different stages of the process. The red flags tool will automatically check procurement documents from the Tenders Electronic Daily (TED) and filter risky procurements through a special algorithm. Subscribers or visitors will receive alerts if risky procurements are published (generally or in their special field of interest) so they can easily check these reports, comment on them, provide additional information or upload relevant documents or photos.</p>","We're going to build an open source red flags tool for EU countries, that can help citizens and journalists almost all around Europe to detect risky procurements and prevent fraud &amp; corruption.","Public funds are spent through an overcomplicated procurement system full of loopholes, moreover procurement practice and the supervision of the processes look even worse. Since authorities do not have the capacity (and sometimes the will) to monitor thousands of procurements a year, tools are needed to support this process. Countries spend between 5-15 % of their GDPs through public procurement, where huge amounts are wasted and misused. This project aims to save these funds for better causes.","We applied with this idea to the 2013 News Challenge on Open Data but did not make it to the finals. Fortunately we received funding from other sources to build a pilot version in Hungary and the site will be launched in a couple of weeks. We've built several dozen indicators and a database structure that is synchronized with the Tenders European Daily. Since our the concept worked out, we would like to extend the project to other member states and make it as user-friendly as possible.","We would like to see this tool working in other EU countries, and we would also like to see a more effective fight against corruption in public procurements in the EU with the help of this tool.

It takes a great deal of data and research to determine what changes should be made to improve resident’s lives and often the need for improvement is urgent. The good news is that technologies that can scan, sniff, and gather that data are becoming smaller and less expensive as time goes on.  The term “Internet of Things” has emerged alongside new ways of thinking about what the data driven city will soon look like.  Unfortunately, the dominant offerings in the IoT marketplace are often hampered by closed architectures that limit the types of data that can be collected, how it can be used, and how the architecture can evolve.  Municipal governments often face significant hurdles in granting the public access and creating opportunities for collaboration in working with the data. </p>","The District of Columbia and the Open Technology Institute will partner to build an open-source, open-hardware sensor network that allows community members to learn how to design their own data-driven storytelling platform.","The ability of community members to effectively elevate important issues is hampered by a lack of access to supportive data.

The amount of effort that it takes for them to find a new restaurant, a band they like, or look up a specialty event at a local venue is too time consuming and frustrating. One has to read posters at local cafes, ‘like’ scores of Facebook pages, skim poorly organized blogs, filter through university calendars, and scour the websites of local newspapers to learn the cultural options available, all the while filtering the information to consider the information that matters to him or her. Instead, an online tool should connect individuals with local happenings by centralizing information through one interface. Social media channels and mobile device applications could then be used to share and promote events through potential attendees and not just venues. Likewise event organizers and business owners need an infrastructure that is designed for a small city and is better optimized than Twitter, Facebook, and email lists to communicate with their consumers.

Local magazines are on the decline, especially as event promoters look to the Internet to advertise. In large cities, business owners grow email lists and social media followings gaining enough traction when a small percentage of those invited attend. This is more difficult in small cities. What local sources inform the millennial generation who look online for such information?","Our team has developed the hierarchy of information, the database design, and design goals for the visual interface.

A choice can also be made to release these insights to programs.","As an organization that supports several collective impact initiatives throughout the State of Colorado, we constantly encounter redundant effort, misaligned resources, and most importantly, individuals that are unaware of the systems that exist to improve their lives. The Civic Network will chip away at these inefficiencies by providing the right insight to the right entity. We will proactively address the privacy concerns around big data by emphasizing access decisions at the individual level.","Denver Public Schools committed to a bold first pilot project of the Civic Network— The Community Partnership System (CPS). The CPS system allows individual partner organizations to complete a profile of their organization, the services they offer, the locations they are offered, and the outcomes/issues they address.

One is a computer model that dynamically links known biological processes with known human activity to illustrate their mutual dependence. It advances conventional economic modeling by linking it to natural resource inputs and outputs. This incorporates what has been termed ""externalities"" into economic decision making. Simultaneously it incorporates real economic needs into the conservation dialogue in quantitative ways allowing for realistic assessment of trade-offs. The second and perhaps primary product is a residual community of stakeholder participants who have contributed to the development of the model. The relationships these stakeholders have built with each other and with the model can be a cornerstone of community decision making. The ongoing refinement of the model is a structured venue for continued stakeholder community building.</p>",Integrating the vast data and theory about human and natural systems in simulation models that link human activity to environmental changes.,"MIMES has been under development for nine (9) years as an academic research initiative.

Jordan,https://www.newschallenge.org/profiles/jcrouser,,Promoting Social Justice and Gender Equality in Data Science,The Statistical & Data Sciences program at Smith College empowers  women and gender-nonconforming students in data science & related fields.,"<p>The emerging discipline of data science focuses on turning data into knowledge. While it is generally considered a STEM discipline, success in data science also requires skills not yet widely taught in other STEM fields: a strong statistical background, an understanding of data provenance, novel database architectures, visualization, contextual understanding of data, and more. Because all other fields generate (and must then analyse) data, one of the charters of data science is to foster scientists who can work across disciplines. Additionally, as noted by Berman and Bourne, “data science offers the opportunity to narrow the gender gap in STEM (in which only 13% of the engineering workforce and 25% of the computer and mathematical sciences workforce are women) by making diversity a priority early on” [1]. As a liberal arts college, Smith is uniquely positioned to make these connections. By developing a program for women and gender non-conforming students with an emphasis on the non-traditional analytical techniques required for success in today’s marketplace, we can make great strides in realizing this vision.</p>","By designing educational environments that promote data science as part of a broader skill set, we hope to make it clear to women and gender-nonconforming students that data analysis can take place in any discipline, and that their engagement is a critical component of the future of data science.","As of 2015, women make up only 13% of the engineering workforce and 25% of the computer and mathematical sciences (<a href=""http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind14/index.cfm/chapter-3/c3h.htm#s4"" target=""_blank"">http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind14/index.cfm/chapter-3/c3h.htm#s4</a>).

The NLSY97 is a longitudinal study begun in 1997, by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics. It “consists of a nationally representative sample of approximately 9,000 youths who were 12 to 16 years old as of December 31, 1996. … Youths continue to be interviewed on an annual basis.” The data, “aside from educational and labor market experiences … contains detailed information on many other topics,” including “the youths’ relationships with parents, contact with absent parents, marital and fertility histories, dating, sexual activity, onset of puberty, training, participation in government assistance programs, expectations, time use, criminal behavior, and alcohol and drug use.”</p>",We will build a web-based interactive tool that will help users with limited data analytics skills make sense of publicly available data. Right now the data is only available in the raw format and only a data scientist can explore the data and draw conclusions.,Journalists currently depend upon and wait for an organization such as JJGPS to analyze available data and publish a report before they can report on the ramifications and the essence of that data.

This would empower journalists around the world to make sense of complicated data and report on it more efficiently.,"The NCJJ’s latest effort to present juvenile justice data in user-friendly ways is the JJGPS. They have been periodically publishing reports based on the available data so it can be used by the public and journalists.

For example, Detroit paid $547 million in penalties on toxic swap deals for its water system, leading the city to nearly double water bills and shut off water to thousands of families who couldn’t afford to pay the higher bills.

Some of these documents - hundreds of thousands of pages in binders - were already the subject of an investigative series by our managing editor, Jim Morris. They were featured in the book Deceit and Denial: The Deadly Politics of Industrial Pollution, by historians Davis Rosner of Columbia University and Gerald Markowitz of John Jay College of Criminal Justice, and were the basis of a two-hour documentary by Bill Moyers. The documents shed light on how, for years, the chemical industry knew that vinyl chloride, an ingredient in PVC plastic, was poisonous and deadly but hid that fact from workers and the public.</p>",The Center for Public Integrity is creating a platform to assist people with searching thousands of documents. We’ve created a way to make text in images searchable; and created a tool to add metadata to documents at scale. Both of these dramatically reduce the time required to read and manually classify documents to make them useful for the public and for researchers. We will start with court documents involving the chemical industry but the platform can be applied to any mass document set.,"The project entails taking a tool like DocumentCloud a step further. While a highly functional tool in its own right,  users of DocumentCloud must manually input all data about a document to give it context. Our platform will do this with robots, allowing us to make available a large number of documents – in this case about the secret history of the chemical industry – without the manual effort of reading and inputting data about each document.","In late 2014, we launched a pilot database of documents about the carcinogen benzene. In doing so, we were able to include on each document the name of the lawsuit from which it came, the court handling the case, and the date it was filed. We also made it possible for readers to search for the original complaint filed in each case, so each document would have some context.","Success would be measured in two ways. One would be an ever-expanding database of toxic- chemical documents not in the public domain that would be used by journalists, academic researchers, lawyers, activists and the public. Another marker of success would be the development of a  platform that could be used for any large database of documents.","CPI reporter David Heath has years of experience in data journalism.

City governments are making efforts to expand and improve public transport access, but traditional approaches to transport demand modeling focus too much on connecting neighborhoods, and not enough on access—connecting citizens to jobs, services, and entertainment.","Several of our team members are from the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), where they have been working to develop “percentage near transit” (PNT) a metric to measure rapid transit accessibility in cities. We have also surveyed the field and begun to develop a list of other academic, private sector, and NGO approaches that show promise for improving understanding of accessibility.","A successful outcome would be to advance the PNT metric, and to develop and distribute a framework based on the results of the Citizen Accessibility Project. The Framework would then be promoted in ITDP partner cities and at UN, transport, and citizen data conferences. Success will be measured by level of interest from other cities in using the framework, as well as endorsement from sustainable transport organizations and practitioners.","Bernardo Baranda, Mexico Outreach and Strategy Lead. <br>Melinda Hanson, Project Manager. <br>Colin Hughes, Policy Lead.  <br>Jacob Mason, Data Lead. <br>Katja Schechtner, Technology Advisor. <br>Phil Sayeg, Economic Advisor.","The pilot project will focus on Mexico City.

Based on this definition, everyone with no discrimination and restriction is able to have availability and access to some data to use, reuse and redistribute. For promoting open knowledge, it is imperative to fulfil at least two of these three processes. In this sense, the idea of this project is to foster open data and open knowledge in digital community centers across Latin America.</p>","We will develop collaborative data-based projects in our digital community centers in Latin America to provide news, information and knowledge resources, working with centers’ users and other community actors.","Despite efforts by many Latin American governments to promote open data by adopting an open government agenda and access to information laws, citizens remain uninsterested.  This is part due to the lack understanding of the importance and life changing potential of open data which is considered an issue for specialized journalists and scholars. Governments are also still reluctant to make data available to citizens. This project will promote the use and reuse of data to improve information.","We already have the infrastructure for the project and the people who use and reuse the open data. We have established a network of 161 “POETA” digital community centers in Latin America. The centers are operated by more than 65 civil society partners organizations.

Increasingly, the products of data and computer science are reshaping systems of power in our society. Journalists need to recognize their actions in the world, holding algorithms and data processing techniques accountable for the ways our society operates. As a result, the practice of journalism is also undergoing a significant change, with select reporters finding themselves wielding data, code and algorithms to find and tell new kinds of stories, stories that were not previously conceivable. But this presents the discipline, and, in particular, the institutions entrusted with the mission of preparing new journalists, with difficult questions about their vision for the future: Who should perform this new kind of reporting? Will it be a minority exercise, with specialized data desks staffed by consultants, or is it something that every reporter should be able perform on their own or at least hold their own in a collaboration? At the time of writing, different institutions have expressed various opinions through their curricula - from teaching basic statistics, to offering novel dual degree programs joint with data or computer science. Many of these approaches are, at their core, slightly cynical, suggesting that students traditionally drawn to journalism are not capable of original work even in basic statistics. </p>","Making a programming environment that is tailored for journalists and journalism students, by using metaphors and new technologies that make programming more tangible to them.","We believe that it is almost indispensable for journalists, in the future, to have some level of familiarity with programming. Today, there are likely too many hurdles to make that vision happen. In particular, the software being used in newsrooms, such as command-line tools or text editors, were developed with engineers and computer scientists in mind. We believe that, on the contrary, better, more adapted pedagogical methods and tools can help overcome these issues.","This tool would be the result of a year-long inquiry led at the Columbia Journalism School and benefiting from a grant of the Tow Center until January. We have done significant research and reaching out during the last few months. In particular, we have been reviewing a lot of different CS education initiatives, and especially the ones implying the creation of programming languages. At this moment, we are trying to identify the key hurdles by reaching out to the data journalism community.","The best case scenario for our project would be a feat similar to Processing. Processing was conceived for graphical design students who needed to learn computation, notably by organizing the language around the metaphor of the painter to make programming more relatable to them. Nowadays, Processing is de facto the standard programming environment for graphical designers. Another great outcome for our project would be to successfully introduce our environment into Journalism classrooms.","Mark Hansen - Director, Columbia University Brown Institute for Media Innovation. 30+ years in experience in statistics and data.

In a media environment where we increasingly consume information on decontextualized news feeds, journalists are creating annotated, context-rich “explainers” to help readers confidently explore new ideas and topics. We have developed FOLD <a href=""http://www.fold.cm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">www.fold.cm</a> as the first open network to allow anyone to create explanatory stories, with the hope that the ability to easily integrate multimedia context alongside a story will help writers and readers confidently share and explore a wider diversity of stories online.</p>","As context-driven “explainer” journalism grows, we are investigating the ways that semantic data about media-rich references within a story can be used to connect individual stories into topic threads that build new online communities.","Readers need context to confidently explore a wider range of ideas online. However, because media is often consumed on personalized news feeds, it is difficult for people to reach outside their friend circle or existing consumption habits. By using data about a story’s reference material to create new associations within and across subject topics, we aim to build tools that encourage new communities to form, increasing serendipity and helping a wider range of voices and ideas to be discovered.","Since the launch of a beta desktop version of FOLD <a href=""http://www.fold.cm"" target=""_blank"">http://www.fold.cm</a> in late April we have generating over 500 unique stories.

So far, this local data has been used to pass 38 local-level policies (e.g., prohibiting tobacco sales in pharmacies) that create neighborhoods that promote health, rather than detract from it.","Our goal is to equip communities with the data and stories they need to pass policies that create healthier neighborhoods. For example: new tobacco retailer licensing ordinances to grant the revocable privilege of selling the world’s most deadly product, restricting the sales of tobacco products within walking distance of children’s schools, or prohibiting tobacco sales in pharmacies.

Global remittance flows are estimated to exceed $500 billion a year--more that official development assistance. It is estimated that more than half a million Senegalese migrants live abroad, over 100,00 of which in NYC. </p>",We want to show and test how data can be used as a powerful lever of change at the community level by working with the NYC Senegalese community on the critical issue of remittances to foster their incentive and ability to be engaged on an important policy topic through data by developing and delivering information tools such as a collaborative online knowledge platform and participatory training activities referred to as 'Data Capsules' out of Data-Pop Alliance's offices at ThoughtWorks NYC.,"For most diaspora, the remittance data ecosystem remains a mystery, and communities cannot make informed decisions nor engage in a dialogue about their options due to lack of access to data, data analytics tools and opportunities for discussion, while knowledge of transfer fees and other key issues is also very low; this gap extends beyond the Senegalese diaspora, to many diaspora communities across the United States.","We have made connections and contact with the local Senegalese diaspora in New York City and have secured a location for trainings at Thoughtworks NYC. We have a team of data scientists from ThoughtWorks, MIT Media Lab and the Senegalese data ecosystem ready to work on the project.",We hope that the results and products from the Sendata project in New York--the trainings and knowledge platform--will help the community engage in debates about remittances through data and be prototypes to be scaled by other diaspora communities in the US.

Who does the counting? Who is ultimately counted or not counted? Such are the questions that stem from what is a simple number at its surface, yet speaks to a complex system underlying the politics of counting, race logics, state imperatives, and the intersection of recognition and power over Indigenous population data. In the United States, there are 565 Federally Recognized American Indian Tribes. Each tribe has a unique language, culture, ways of knowing and being, homeland, and relationship with the Federal Government and other Indian Tribes. These are tribal nations responsible for the well-being of not only their tribal members, but also the land, the animals, and everything seen and unseen. In order to build strong tribal nations, Tribal Leaders must grapple with difficult decisions in the 21st century. Central to these decisions is the opportunity inherent in viewing tribal data development as a key exercise of tribal sovereignty. As tribal governments and Indigenous leadership entities become increasingly empowered to undertake significant economic, social, and cultural development activities in their communities so too does their need for accurate information on their peoples. For too long, tribes have relied on external sources of data to tell them about their peoples and to future proof their nations. It is time to build a data sovereignty agenda amongst tribes that will empower tribal leaders and communities with robust data to make informed governance decisions on their terms. </p>","The time is now to develop relevant and sustainable tribal data systems that drive economic, social, and cultural development by Indigenous communities for Indigenous communities.","In the last decade, there has been a burgeoning interest in Indigenous population data and how such data might be used to advance the self-determining aspirations of Indigenous peoples.We are slow to the mark here in the United States and the time is now to start examining how we can build strong data futures by and for American Indian tribes and communities! It is time to start building Indigenous Data Warriors!","In May '15, I was invited to present at the Third Annual International Open Data Conference in Ottawa. Indigenous data access and use was not on the radar of the thousands of international data experts from government, academia, and the private sector. It is now! Since May I've collected interviews from 15 tribal leaders to start building a tribal data movement in the U.S and also contributed to an International Indigenous Data Workshop in Australia in July to leverage international momentum.","1.

The first of these reports was published by last March companies in Norway, and reports from the entire European Union will follow in 2016. Getting these transparency laws passed was a major advancement and now we need to create the tools necessary for civil society groups to use the payment information.</p>","To develop a report identifying the key information that can be extracted from oil, gas and mining companies' annual securities filings, and to turn that report into an online tool for civil society activists in resource rich countries to demand corporate and government accountability.","Completely counter to conventional wisdom, countries that are the richest in natural resources often suffer from some of the world’s most entrenched poverty. For example, 8 of the bottom 10 countries on the United Nation’s Human Development Index rely on oil or mineral resources for the bulk of their export earnings. This paradox is known as the ‘resource curse,’ and is largely the result of mismanagement and corruption.","Publish What You Pay – Canada produced two reports analyzing Canadian companies’ securities disclosures and detailing the useful information that could be found. We will use these two reports, Lifting the Veil and An Eye on Disclosure as a guide for the PWYP-US report.

Low levels of belief in evolution are highly correlated with low youth interest in pursuing education and careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) [2]. New interventions aimed at addressing these concerns are needed if the representation of underrepresented minorities in the STEM workforce is to increase and if further declines in the percentage of American youth entering STEM careers are to be avoided. Great concern also surrounds the health of African American and Latinos in the U.S. because of the high prevalence of lifestyle diseases in both groups. The introduction of meaningful, enjoyable, and lasting lifestyle education is essential to the development of Cultures of Health at individual, family, and societal levels, and is particularly important for communities at risk for lifestyle diseases. Questions then arise as to the best timing and the most appropriate mode for such interventions. The optimal age is not high school or college-age because, by then, many youth have already made decisions to pursue non-STEM educational courses or careers. Youth aged</p>","We are designing a camp, offered in collaboration with two Universities (one in Pennsylvania, one in South Carolina), and a major metropolitan museum (in New York), that will use a genealogy and genetics approach to engage students from marginalized populations (students of color, students from lower SES, students with special needs, girls, etc) in the doing of science.  Students will use a direct-to-consumer DNA test and genealogical research to explore the question: Who Am I?",There are several goals of this project.  In the broadest sense we are trying to increase diversity in the  STEM fields.  We are attempting to do this by creating opportunities for underrepresented minorities to be successful in the thinking about and doing of science using their own genetic and genealogical data.  We also want to create opportunities for students to see the connections between who they are genetically and who they are as a function of personal choices like diet and exercise.,"We have received funding to design and implement the camp from a philanthropic foundation.  This funding secures the design of curriculum and participation in camps for approximately 60-80 students during the summer of 2016 and 2017.  Unfortunately, this funding is not available for use in the acquisition and/or purchase of any technology like iPads or FitBits.  We are seeking funding for iPads for use in the camps, and funding to provide a FitBit Charge HR for each student to use and keep.","In the long-term, greater diversity in STEM fields.  In the shorter-term, greater interest and participation of camp attendees in STEM-related classes in middle school, high school, and college.

When those caseworkers leave, so too does the institutional knowledge with them. There are a small number of serious efforts to digitize this information and make it more accessible. These however are typically not consumer-facing nor human-centered, so the information remains firmly in the hands of “experts,” creating additional barriers to utilization. Furthermore, to the small extent there may be working solutions for a particular community, a wide scale instance hasn’t been realized.</p>","LivWel is a two-sided marketplace where community members can learn about and directly engage with the resources that support good health and community-based organizations, health departments, and providers can connect with their audience.","The primary users are individuals who need to access health and human services. This user group tends to reside in urban areas and be of lower socioeconomic status. They often face structural barriers to linking to care that are particularly pronounced as a result of their membership in already marginalized communities. Many struggle to navigate the complex system of services on their own, often getting bounced around until they ultimately give up or wind up in more critical circumstances.","Over the past year, we have engaged hundreds of stakeholders in SE Michigan, validating many of our initial assumptions, invalidating others, and garnering significant support along the way, including partnerships with a local specialty pharmacy and a network of AIDS service organizations serving the region. This work has allowed us to develop lo-fi prototypes which we are in the process of testing with users and now seeking to shape into a MVP.","Many who need to access health services can't or won't connect with a caseworker who will help them do so.  Conversely, many caseworkers themselves struggle to keep up with the constantly changing landscape of services.  We aim to democratize the information available about these resources, so individuals can have it at their fingertips.  For community organizations and public health departments, we will be able to provide better insights about service utilization to guide resource allocation.","Ryan Gourley is a recent graduate from The University of Michigan, where he received Masters degrees in Entrepreneurship and Natural Resources &amp; Environment.

But while the open data revolution has made some forms of data more accessible than ever, other data sources are increasingly restricted, or complex and difficult to interpret. Journalists today don’t just need tools and platforms to help them visualize and publish data; they need the expertise, skills and resources to create new data, and to interpret and translate the data that does exist in ways that are accurate and nuanced.</p>",,"Data journalism that better informs citizens is on the rise. Yet despite a plethora of tools, newsrooms lack statistical expertise to accurately interpret complex data. In cases where data is unavailable or suppressed, newsrooms lack capacity to conduct data collection on their own. Meanwhile, many academics have access to and are producing data that could add context and scientific rigor to public dialogue, but they struggle to bring their findings to the general public.","We are involved in several projects and partnerships that prototype collaborative data methods that we propose to scale up with the support of this grant.

More than ever, corruption in one country or region can be linked to corruption across borders and jurisdictions, presenting new challenges to local investigators. DataShare will be the bridge between local knowledge and a global collective intelligence. It will be a critical tool for journalists, government officials, NGOs or any community or sector that wishes to conduct investigations within a network model, across borders or inside a country. </p>","DataShare allows for valuable knowledge about people and companies locked within hundreds of pages of documents inside a computer to be sieved into indexes and shared securely within a network of trusted individuals, fostering unforeseen collaboration and prompting new and better investigations that uncover corruption, transnational crime and abuse of power.","Networks of trusted individuals don’t always know if there are connections between the documents and data each member holds. Even if their information is stored in a common searchable repository, a connection will only be found if the user knows what to search for. DataShare allows for easy extraction and secure sharing of lists of names of people, companies or addresses and the automated discovery of unknown connections that can lead to new investigations.","DataShare’s initial idea was suggested in 2013 by an ICIJ member. Since then, ICIJ has been researching ways to build on the collective intelligence of the network through technology. A survey of our reporters confirmed its importance. Starting in October we’ll begin running the first tests on named entity extraction in collaboration with the Artificial Intelligence Department of Madrid Polytechnic University. The project has already received initial seed funding by the Open Society Foundations.","ICIJ will use DataShare for its own network of 200 journalists and its regular use will lead to more cross-border collaborations between some of the best investigative reporters in the world, who publish in leading media worldwide. Our goal is for other networks to use the tool as well – not only those in journalism but people in law enforcement, activism, or other areas – to achieve better results in any kind of investigation or public interest campaigns.","The tool will be developed by ICIJ’s Data &amp; Research Unit, which already builds collaboration platforms that help hundreds of reporters safely communicate and do remote research. With more than 20 years of software engineering experience combined, web developer Matthew Caruana Galizia and software engineer and database expert Rigoberto Carvajal will oversee the technical aspects of the project. With funding we also expect to expand our team to include more dedicated programming resources.","ICIJ’s headquarters are in Washington DC. Our members are located across 65 countries.

No comprehensive data currently on how harassment affects women of color online. Several investigative journalism pieces have implied that changing avatars from women of color to white men lessens the harassment targeted populations receive. University of Maryland conducted a study where researchers created fake online accounts and used them in chat rooms. About 100 threatening or sexually explicit messages were directed at users with ""feminine"" usernames each day; ""masculine"" usernames incurred a mere 3.7 in comparison. But similar studies have not been conducted with race and gender as the focus. We need more adequate data on how online abuse impacts women of color and trans people in order to help address the problem more effectively, especially since there have been claims by targets of this harassment that there is racial and gender stratification regarding how harassment complaints are handled by some tech companies.</p>","We aim to quantify how online harassment impacts women of color and gender non conforming people of color using more inclusive, intersectional data collection processes.","The vicious targeting of women, women of color, queer women, trans women, disabled women, and other oppressed groups who speak up on online has reached crisis levels. Hate speech &amp;violent threats are being used to silence the voices of women &amp;gender non-conforming people in the public discourse everyday.  A Pew study found that fully 25 percent of young women online have been sexually harassed but the racially-motivated, Islamophobic, and transphobic attacks haven't been adequately counted.","Our report Reporting, Reviewing, And Responding To Harassment on Twitter was produced by researchers from the fields of social science, anthropology, sociology, network science and computer science in 2015. It was reviewed by 5 academic researchers in a double-blind, revise-and-resubmit peer review process. Our report provides a baseline for Twitter &amp;  other tech decision makers to make structural and policy changes. Policy changes at Twitter &amp; engagement with Google followed this report.","It will be successful when we can more comprehensively define how online misogyny disproportionately impacts people of color &amp;trans populations, so we can take our existing research to the next level.We hope to develop an intersectional data collection process that includes best practices for gathering data for targeted communities without compromising privacy &amp; safety.This data can be used to help measure whether platform &amp; bystander responses to harassment vary based on race &amp; gender identity.","Proposed team members are listed here (see ""about this report""): <a href=""http://womenactionmedia.org/cms/assets/uploads/2015/05/wam-twitter-abuse-report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">http://womenactionmedia.org/cms/assets/uploads/2015/05/wam-twitter-abuse-report.pdf</a>","New York, NY USA"
